## Introduction

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the transformer-based embeddings training pipeline. The pipeline is designed to train a hybrid transformer model that generates text embeddings using large datasets. The codebase includes model training, data loading, metric tracking, and checkpointing functionalities.

## Environment Setup

To run the pipeline, set up your environment as follows:

1. Install necessary Python packages:

   ```sh
   pip install torch transformers datasets wandb pinecone-client
   ```

2. Load environment variables from the `.env` file:

   ```python
   load_dotenv('api.env')
   ```

   This will load your Pinecone API key and any other required environment variables.

## Configuration Management

Configuration management is handled using the `ConfigManager` class, which loads and validates the YAML configuration file (`config.yaml`). This file contains parameters such as model architecture, data paths, logging configurations, and training hyperparameters.

```python
class ConfigManager:
    def __init__(self, config_path: str = "config.yaml"):
        self.config_path = config_path
        self.config = self.load_config()
        self._validate_config()
```

The configuration file must include the following sections:

- `model`: Parameters for the model.
- `data`: Paths and settings for loading datasets.
- `tokenizer`: Settings for loading the tokenizer.
- `logging`: Directory and level of logging.
- `checkpointing`: Directory for saving model checkpoints.
- `training`: Hyperparameters for training.

## Logging Setup

Logging is used throughout the training pipeline for debugging and tracking. Logs are saved to a file in the directory specified in the configuration.

```python
def setup_logging(config: Dict[str, Any]):
    log_dir = config['logging']['save_dir']
    os.makedirs(log_dir, exist_ok=True)
    log_file = os.path.join(log_dir, 'training.log')
    logging.basicConfig(level=log_level, filename=log_file, format='%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
```

## Metrics Tracking

Metrics are tracked using the `MetricsTracker` class. The metrics tracked include BLEU and ROUGE scores, which are calculated based on reference and hypothesis text.

```python
class MetricsTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.scorer = rouge_scorer.RougeScorer(['rouge1', 'rouge2', 'rougeL'], use_stemmer=True)
        self.bleu_scores = []
```

## Model Management

Model management is handled by the `ModelManager` class. The transformer model is built using a custom function from `model.py`. The model is configured with parameters such as `src_vocab_size`, `tgt_vocab_size`, `src_seq_len`, `tgt_seq_len`, and `d_model`.

```python
class ModelManager:
    def initialize_model(self) -> Tuple[nn.Module, Tokenizer]:
        tokenizer_path = self.config['tokenizer']['load_path']
        tokenizer = Tokenizer.from_file(tokenizer_path)
        transformer = model.build_unified_transformer(src_vocab_size=src_vocab_size, ...)
        return transformer, tokenizer
```

## Security Utilities

To ensure safe data usage, the `SecurityUtils` class provides methods for validating input data:

- Checks for maximum input length.
- Checks for non-printable characters.
- Checks for suspicious patterns in input text to prevent injection attacks.

```python
class SecurityUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def validate_input_data(texts: List[str], max_length: int = 1000000) -> None:
        # Validates text data
```

## Data Management

Data is loaded using the `DataManager` class. It can load different datasets, including OpenWebText, PubMed QA, and custom local data files. It supports parallel data loading and prefetching using the `AsyncPrefetchDataLoader` class.

```python
class DataManager:
    def load_openwebtext(self) -> List[str]:
        dataset = load_dataset("openwebtext", split=f"train[:{self.config['data']['max_samples']}]")
        return [item['text'] for item in dataset]
```

The class also provides functions for parallel processing of data to tokenize and batch data efficiently.

## Training Loop

The model is trained using the `train_model` function, which handles multiple aspects of training:

- Uses mixed precision training for faster and memory-efficient training.
- Tracks training and validation losses.
- Supports early stopping and gradient accumulation.

```python
@handle_oom
def train_model(...):
    model.train()
    scaler = GradScaler(enabled=config['training']['mixed_precision'])
    ...
```

The training loop also incorporates error handling using the `handle_oom` decorator to manage out-of-memory errors.

## Checkpoint Management

The `CheckpointManager` class is used to save model checkpoints during training. Checkpoints are saved periodically, and older checkpoints are deleted if they exceed the maximum number allowed.

```python
class CheckpointManager:
    def save_checkpoint(self, model: nn.Module, optimizer: torch.optim.Optimizer, epoch: int, loss: float, metrics: Dict[str, float]) -> None:
        checkpoint_path = self.save_dir / f"checkpoint_epoch_{epoch}.pt"
        torch.save(checkpoint_data, checkpoint_path)
```

This functionality is useful for resuming training from a particular point or preventing loss of progress due to interruptions.

## Embedding Generation

The `EmbeddingGenerator` class is responsible for generating embeddings for a given input sequence and saving them to Pinecone.

```python
class EmbeddingGenerator:
    def generate_embeddings(self, input_ids: List[List[int]], batch_size: int = 32) -> torch.Tensor:
        self.model.eval()
        ...
```

After training, this class helps create embeddings to store in a Pinecone index, which can be used for downstream tasks like similarity search or clustering.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the transformer-based embeddings training pipeline. It covers configuration management, data loading, model training, checkpoint management, and embedding generation. Each pipeline component is designed for modularity, making it easier to extend or replace parts of the system as needed.
