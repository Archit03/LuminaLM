## **Introduction**

The `embeddings.py` script is designed for training a Transformer-based model, managing the dataset, and generating embeddings. It provides a structured approach for:
- Data loading and preprocessing.
- Model training with validation and checkpointing.
- Efficient embedding generation and management.

The file utilizes several advanced features like mixed precision training, memory monitoring, caching, and distributed data loading to optimize the workflow.

The script uses numerous dependencies that include:
- **PyTorch** for deep learning tasks.
- **Tokenizers** and **Datasets** for text processing and dataset handling.
- **Multiprocessing**, **threading**, and **asyncio** to improve efficiency.
- **WandB** for experiment tracking.
- **Numpy**, **Pickle**, and **Matplotlib** for numerical operations, serialization, and visualization.
