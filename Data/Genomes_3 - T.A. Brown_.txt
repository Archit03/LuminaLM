Preface
Four exciting years have elapsed since publication of the Second Edition of Genomes.
Finished sequences of human chromosomes have appeared at regular intervals and a draft of
the chimpanzee genome has been completed. The number of eukaryotes with partial or complete sequences is increasing dramatically, and new prokaryotic sequences are announced
virtually every week. Experimental techniques for studying transcriptomes and proteomes
are providing novel insights into genome expression and the new discipline of systems biology is linking genome studies with cellular biochemistry. All of these advances have been
incorporated into Genomes 3. In particular, what was previously a single chapter on genome
anatomies has been expanded into three chapters, and I have greatly increased the material
on post-genomics by writing separate chapters on how sequences are analyzed and how transcriptomes and proteomes are studied. I have also taken the opportunity to give greater depth
to the descriptions of genome expression, replication and recombination.
The changes have led to an expansion in the length of Genomes, and to balance this I have
tried to make the book more user friendly. Boxes are now used only for descriptions of techniques, so the text as a whole is less broken up and forms a more continuous narrative. The
artwork has been completely redesigned, bringing greater clarity to the figures and giving the
book a more attractive appearance. The reading lists and end-of-chapter problem sets have
undergone an equally comprehensive re-evaluation.
In making these revisions I have taken account of feedback provided by a number of lecturers and students from various parts of the world. These people are literally “too many to mention” so I would like to say a general thank you. The one person to whom I will extend individual thanks is Daniela Delneri of the University of Manchester, whose comments on the
chapters concerning post-genomics and molecular evolution were so comprehensive that I
found it almost unnecessary to do any research into these areas myself. I am extremely grateful to Ted Lee from the Department of Biology, SUNY Fredonia, NY, for taking on the daunting (at least to me) task of writing comprehensive sets of questions and problems for each
chapter – these learning aids greatly enhance the quality of the book. Also, I thank Dominic
Holdsworth and Jackie Harbor of Garland Science for the tremendous support that they provided when I was writing Genomes 3, and Matthew McClements for his excellent redesigns of
the artwork. Finally, Genomes 3 would not have appeared without the support of my wife,
Keri. In the Acknowledgements to the First Edition I wrote that “if you find this book useful
then you should thank Keri, not me, because she is the one who ensured that it was written”,
and I am pleased that one or two people have actually taken me up on this.

A Note to the Reader
I have tried to make the third edition of Genomes as user friendly as possible. The book therefore includes a number of devices intended to help the reader and to make the book an effective teaching aid.

Organization of the Book
Genomes is divided into four parts:
Part 1 – Studying Genomes begins with an orientation chapter that introduces the reader to
genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes, and then moves on to the methods, centered on
cloning and PCR, that were used in the pre-genome era to examine individual genes (Chapter
2). The techniques that are more specifically used for studying genomes are then described in
the order in which they would be used in a genome project: methods for constructing genetic
and physical maps (Chapter 3); DNA sequencing methodology and the strategies used to
assemble a contiguous genome sequence (Chapter 4); methods for identifying genes in a
genome sequence and determining the functions of those genes in the cell (Chapter 5); and
approaches for studying transcriptomes and proteomes (Chapter 6). The Human Genome
Project forms a continuous thread throughout Part 1, but this is not to the exclusion of all else
and I have tried to give adequate coverage to the strategies that have been used, and are being
used, to understand the genomes of other organisms.
Part 2 – Genome Anatomies surveys the anatomies of the various type of genome that are
found on our planet. Chapter 7 covers eukaryotic nuclear genomes with primary emphasis on
the human genome. Chapter 8 deals with the genomes of prokaryotes and of eukaryotic
organelles, the latter included here because of their prokaryotic origins, and Chapter 9
describes virus genomes and mobile genetic elements, these being grouped together because
some types of mobile element are related to virus genomes.
Part 3 – How Genomes Function covers the material that in the past has been described inadequately as “DNA goes to RNA goes to protein”. Chapter 10 addresses the increasingly
important issue of how chromatin structure influences genome expression. Chapter 11 then
describes the assembly of the transcription initiation complexes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and includes a detailed discussion of DNA-binding proteins, these playing the central
roles in the initial stages of genome expression. Chapters 12 and 13 give details of the synthesis of the transcriptome and proteome, and Chapter 14 surveys the regulation of genome activity. Keeping Chapter 14 to a manageable length is difficult, as many different topics are relevant
to genome regulation, but I hope that by using specific examples to illustrate general themes I
have managed to achieve a satisfactory balance between conciseness and breadth of coverage.
Part 4 – How Genomes Replicate and Evolve links DNA replication, mutation and recombination with the gradual evolution of genomes over time. In Chapters 15–17 the molecular

Genomes 3 prelims

A Note to the Reader

processes responsible for replication, mutation, repair and recombination are described, and
in Chapter 18 the ways in which these processes are thought to have shaped the structures
and genetic contents of genomes over evolutionary time are considered. Finally, Chapter 19
is devoted to the increasingly informative use of molecular phylogenetics to infer the evolutionary relationships between DNA sequences.

Organization of Chapters
Learning outcomes
Each chapter starts with a set of learning outcomes. These have been phrased very carefully.
They are not merely a series of synopses of the factual content of each chapter, but instead
indicate the level and type of knowledge that the student should gain from reading the chapter. Therefore, the learning outcomes state what the student should be able to describe, draw,
discuss, explain, evaluate, each verb having been selected to convey precisely what it is that
the student is expected to be able to do. The intention is that the student is left in no doubt
about what they should get out of each chapter, and hence is in no doubt about whether they
have dealt satisfactorily with the material.

Figures
A good diagram is certainly worth a thousand words but a bad one can confuse the reader
and a superfluous one is merely distracting. I have therefore tried to ensure that every figure
is necessary and fulfills a purpose beyond simply breaking up the text and making the book
look pretty. I have also tried to make figures reproducible because in my opinion this makes
them much more useful as a learning aid for the student. I have never understood the penchant for making textbook diagrams into works of art because if the student cannot redraw
a diagram then it is merely an illustration and does not help the student learn the information that it is designed to convey. The figures in Genomes 3 are as clear, simple, and uncluttered as possible.

Technical Notes
The main text is supported and extended by a series of technical notes, contained in separate
boxes. Each technical note is a self-contained description of a technique or a group of techniques important in the study of genomes. The technical notes are designed to be read in conjunction with the main text, each one being located at the place in the book where an application of that technique is described for the first time.

Questions, Problems, and Figure Tests
Four different types of self-study exercise are given at the end of each chapter:
G

Multiple choice questions cover the key points from the chapter and test the student’s
basic understanding of the material. Traditionalists sometimes debate the value of multiple choice questions in formal assessments, but there can be no doubt of their value as
a review aid: if a student can accurately answer every one of them then they almost certainly have an excellent knowledge of the factual content of the chapter.

G

Short answer questions require 50- to 300-word answers, or occasionally ask for an annotated diagram or a table. The questions cover the entire content of each chapter in a fairly
straightforward manner, and most can be marked simply by checking each answer against
the relevant part of the text. A student can use the short answer questions to work systematically through a chapter, or can select individual ones in order to evaluate their ability to
answer questions on specific topics. The short answer questions could also be used in
closed-book tests.

Genomes 3 prelims

A Note to the Reader

G

In-depth problems require a more detailed answer. They vary in nature and in difficulty,
the simplest requiring little more than a literature survey, the intention with these problems
being that the student advances his or her learning a few stages from where Genomes 3
leaves off. Other problems require that the student evaluates a statement or a hypothesis,
based on their understanding of the material in the book, possibly supplemented by reading around the subject. These problems will, hopefully, engender a certain amount of
thought and critical awareness. A few problems are difficult, in some cases to the extent
that there is no solid answer to the question posed. These are designed to stimulate debate
and speculation, which stretches the knowledge of each student and forces them to think
carefully about their statements. The in-depth problems can be tackled by students working individually, or alternatively can form the starting point for a group discussion.

G

Figure tests are similar to short answer questions, but use selected figures from the preceding chapter as the focal point of the exercise. These tests are valuable as a means of
linking factual information gained from reading the text with the structures and processes
that are illustrated by the figures. A good diagram is indeed worth a thousand words, but
only if the diagram is studied carefully and fully understood. The figure tests help to provide this type of understanding.

For the multiple choice, short answer questions and figure tests, answers to odd-numbered
questions are given in the Appendix. Upon request, answers to all questions will be provided
to instructors who adopt the book via Garland Science Classwire™. For the in-depth problems, guidance rather than answers are provided.

Further Reading
The reading lists at the end of each chapter include those research papers, reviews and books
that I look on as the most useful sources of additional material. My intention throughout
Genomes 3 has been that students should be able to use the reading lists to obtain further
information when writing extended essays or dissertations on particular topics. Research
papers are therefore included, but only if their content is likely to be understandable to the
average reader of the book. Emphasis is placed on accessible reviews such as Science
Perspectives, Nature News and Views and articles in the Trends journals, one strength of these
general articles being the context and relevance that they provide to a piece of work. Most
reading lists are divided into sections reflecting the organization of information in the chapter, and in some cases I have appended a few words summarizing the particular value of each
item, to help the reader decide which ones he or she wishes to seek out. The lists are not allinclusive and I encourage readers to spend some time searching the shelves of their own
libraries for other books and articles. Browsing is an excellent way to discover interests that
you never realized you had!

Glossary
I am very much in favor of glossaries as learning aids and I have provided an extensive one for
this third edition of Genomes. Every term that is highlighted in bold in the text is defined in
the Glossary, along with a number of additional terms that the reader might come across
when referring to books or articles in the reading lists. Each term in the Glossary also appears
in the index, so the reader can quickly gain access to the relevant pages where the Glossary
term is covered in more detail.

The Art of Genomes 3
The CD-ROM packaged with the text contains the images from the book, available in two convenient formats: PowerPoint® and JPEG. The images have been pre-loaded into PowerPoint®
presentations, one presentation for each chapter of the book. The images are also available as
individual JPEG files, which are contained in separate folders from the PowerPoint® presentations. The individual JPEG files have been optimized for printing and Web display.

PART

Studying Genomes

Chapter 1
Part 1 – Studying Genomes describes the techniques and scientific approaches that underlie our
knowledge of genomes. We begin with an orientation chapter that introduces genomes, transcriptomes, and proteomes, and then, in Chapter 2,
move on to the methods, centered on DNA
cloning and the polymerase chain reaction, that
are used to study short segments of DNA, such as
individual genes. Chapter 3 begins our examination of genomics by describing how genetic and
physical maps are constructed, and Chapter 4
makes the link between mapping and sequencing.
As you read Chapter 4 you will realize that
although a map can be a valuable aid to assembly
of a long DNA sequence, mapping is not always an
essential prerequisite to genome sequencing. In
Chapter 5, we look at the various approaches that
are used to understand a genome sequence, and
in Chapter 6 we examine the methods used to
study how a genome functions by directing synthesis of a transcriptome and proteome and,
through these, specifying the biochemical capability of the cell.

When you have read Chapter 1, you should be able to:

Give a detailed description of the structure of a polynucleotide, and summarize the chemical
differences between DNA and RNA.
Discuss the evidence that Watson and Crick used to deduce the double helix structure of DNA and
describe the key features of this structure.
Distinguish between coding and functional RNA and give examples of each type.
Describe in outline how RNA is synthesized and processed in the cell.
Give a detailed description of the various levels of protein structure, and explain why amino acid
diversity underlies protein diversity.
Describe the key features of the genetic code.
Explain why the function of a protein is dependent on its amino acid sequence.
List the major roles of proteins in living organisms and relate this diversity to the function of
the genome.

Life as we know it is specified by the genomes of the myriad organisms with
which we share the planet. Every organism possesses a genome that contains
the biological information needed to construct and maintain a living example of that organism. Most genomes, including the human genome and those
of all other cellular life forms, are made of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) but a
few viruses have RNA (ribonucleic acid) genomes. DNA and RNA are polymeric molecules made up of chains of monomeric subunits called
nucleotides.

Chapter 1 Genomes, Transcriptomes, and Proteomes

The human genome, which is typical of the genomes of all multicellular animals, consists of two distinct parts (Figure 1.1):
G

The nuclear genome comprises approximately 3,200,000,000 nucleotides
of DNA, divided into 24 linear molecules, the shortest 50,000,000
nucleotides in length and the longest 260,000,000 nucleotides, each contained in a different chromosome. These 24 chromosomes consist of 22
autosomes and the two sex chromosomes, X and Y. Altogether, some
35,000 genes are present in the human nuclear genome.

G

The mitochondrial genome is a circular DNA molecule of 16,569
nucleotides, multiple copies of which are located in the energy-generating
organelles called mitochondria. The human mitochondrial genome contains just 37 genes.

components of the human genome.

Nuclear genome

Mitochondrial genome

Each of the approximately 1013 cells in the adult human body has its own
copy or copies of the genome, the only exceptions being those few cell types,
such as red blood cells, that lack a nucleus in their fully differentiated state.
The vast majority of cells are diploid and so have two copies of each autosome, plus two sex chromosomes, XX for females or XY for males—46 chromosomes in all. These are called somatic cells, in contrast to sex cells, or
gametes, which are haploid and have just 23 chromosomes, comprising one
of each autosome and one sex chromosome. Both types of cell have about
8000 copies of the mitochondrial genome, 10 or so in each mitochondrion.
The genome is a store of biological information but on its own it is unable to
release that information to the cell. Utilization of the biological information
contained in the genome requires the coordinated activity of enzymes and
other proteins, which participate in a complex series of biochemical reactions
referred to as genome expression (Figure 1.2). The initial product of genome
expression is the transcriptome, a collection of RNA molecules derived from
those protein-coding genes whose biological information is required by the
cell at a particular time. The transcriptome is maintained by the process called

transcription, in which individual genes are copied into RNA molecules. The
second product of genome expression is the proteome, the cell’s repertoire of
proteins, which specifies the nature of the biochemical reactions that the cell
is able to carry out. The proteins that make up the proteome are synthesized
by translation of the individual RNA molecules present in the transcriptome.
This book is about genomes and genome expression. It explains how
genomes are studied (Part 1), how they are organized (Part 2), how they function (Part 3), and how they replicate and evolve (Part 4). It was not possible to
write this book until very recently. Since the 1950s, molecular biologists have
studied individual genes or small groups of genes, and from these studies
have built up a wealth of knowledge about how genes work. But only during
the last 10 years have techniques been available that make it possible to
examine entire genomes. Individual genes are still intensively studied, but
information about individual genes is now interpreted within the context of
the genome as a whole. This new, broader emphasis applies not just to
genomes but to all of biochemistry and cell biology. No longer is it sufficient
to understand individual biochemical pathways or subcellular processes. The
challenge now is provided by systems biology, which attempts to link
together these pathways and processes into networks that describe the overall functioning of living cells and living organisms.
This book will lead you through our knowledge of genomes and show you
how this exciting area of research is underpinning our developing understanding of biological systems. First, however, we must pay attention to the
basic principles of molecular biology by reviewing the key features of the
three types of biological molecule involved in genomes and genome expression: DNA, RNA, and protein.

1.1 DNA
DNA was discovered in 1869 by Johann Friedrich Miescher, a Swiss biochemist working in Tübingen, Germany. The first extracts that Miescher
made from human white blood cells were crude mixtures of DNA and chromosomal proteins, but the following year he moved to Basel, Switzerland
(where the research institute named after him is now located), and prepared
a pure sample of nucleic acid from salmon sperm. Miescher’s chemical tests
showed that DNA is acidic and rich in phosphorus, and also suggested that
the individual molecules are very large, although it was not until the 1930s,
when biophysical techniques were applied to DNA, that the huge lengths of
the polymeric chains were fully appreciated.

1.1.1 Genes are made of DNA
The fact that genes are made of DNA is so well known today that it can be difficult to appreciate that for the first 75 years after its discovery the true role of
DNA was unsuspected. As early as 1903, W.S. Sutton had realized that the
inheritance patterns of genes parallel the behavior of chromosomes during
cell division, an observation that led to the chromosome theory, the proposal that genes are located in chromosomes. Examination of cells by cytochemistry, after staining with dyes that bind specifically to just one type of
biochemical, showed that chromosomes are made of DNA and protein, in
roughly equal amounts. Biologists at that time recognized that billions of different genes must exist and the genetic material must therefore be able to

take many different forms. But this requirement appeared not to be satisfied
by DNA, because in the early part of the twentieth century it was thought that
all DNA molecules were the same. On the other hand, it was known, correctly,
that proteins are highly variable, polymeric molecules, each one made up of
a different combination of 20 chemically distinct amino-acid monomers
(Section 1.3.1). Hence genes simply had to be made of protein, not DNA.
The errors in understanding DNA structure lingered on, but by the late 1930s
it had become accepted that DNA, like protein, has immense variability. The
notion that protein was the genetic material initially remained strong, but
was eventually overturned by the results of two important experiments:
G

Oswald Avery, Colin MacLeod, and Maclyn McCarty showed that DNA is
the active component of the transforming principle, a bacterial cell
extract which, when mixed with a harmless strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae, converts these bacteria into a virulent form capable of causing
pneumonia when injected into mice (Figure 1.3A). In 1944, when the
results of this experiment were published, only a few microbiologists
appreciated that transformation involves transfer of genes from the cell
extract into the living bacteria. However, once this point had been
accepted, the true meaning of the “Avery experiment” became clear: bacterial genes must be made of DNA.

G

Alfred Hershey and Martha Chase used radiolabeling to show that, when
a bacterial culture is infected with bacteriophages (a type of virus), DNA
is the major component of the bacteriophages that enters the cells (Figure
1.3B). This was a vital observation because it was known that, during the
infection cycle, the genes of the infecting bacteriophages are used to
direct synthesis of new bacteriophages, and this synthesis occurs within
the bacteria. If it is only the DNA of the infecting bacteriophages that
enters the cells, then it follows that the genes of these bacteriophages
must be made of DNA.

Although from our perspective these two experiments provide the key results
that tell us that genes are made of DNA, biologists at the time were not so easily convinced. Both experiments have limitations that leave room for sceptics
to argue that protein could still be the genetic material. For example, there
were worries about the specificity of the deoxyribonuclease enzyme that
Avery and colleagues used to inactivate the transforming principle. This
result, a central part of the evidence for the transforming principle being
DNA, would be invalid if, as seemed possible, the enzyme contained trace
amounts of a contaminating protease and hence was also able to degrade
protein. Neither is the bacteriophage experiment conclusive, as Hershey and
Chase stressed when they published their results: “Our experiments show
clearly that a physical separation of phage T2 into genetic and nongenetic
parts is possible…The chemical identification of the genetic part must wait,
however, until some questions…have been answered.” In retrospect, these
two experiments are important not because of what they tell us but because
they alerted biologists to the fact that DNA might be the genetic material and
was therefore worth studying. It was this that influenced Watson and Crick to
work on DNA and, as we will see below, it was their discovery of the double
helix structure, which solved the puzzling question of how genes can replicate, which really convinced the scientific world that genes are made of DNA.

(A) Avery and colleagues showed that the transforming principle is made of DNA. The top
two panels show what happens when mice are injected with harmless Streptococcus
pneumoniae bacteria, with or without addition of the transforming principle, a cell extract
obtained from a virulent strain of S. pneumoniae. When the transforming principle is present,
the mouse dies, because the genes in the transforming principle convert the harmless
bacteria into the virulent form, these virulent bacteria subsequently being recovered from the
lungs of the dead mouse. The lower two panels show that treatment with protease or
ribonuclease has no effect on the transforming principle, but that the transforming principle is
inactivated by deoxyribonuclease.
(B) The Hershey–Chase experiment used T2 bacteriophages, each of which comprises a
DNA molecule contained in a protein capsid attached to a “body” and “legs” that enable the
bacteriophage to attach to the surface of a bacterium and inject its genes into the cell. The
DNA of the bacteriophages was labeled with 32P, and the protein with 35S. A few minutes
after infection, the culture was agitated to detach the empty phage particles from the cell
surface. The culture was then centrifuged, which collects the bacteria plus phage genes as a
pellet at the bottom of the tube, but leaves the lighter phage particles in suspension.
Hershey and Chase found that the bacterial pellet contained most of the 32P-labeled
component of the phages (the DNA) but only 20% of the 35S-labeled material (the phage
protein). In a second experiment, Hershey and Chase showed that new phages produced at
the end of the infection cycle contained less than 1% of the protein from the parent phages.
For more details of the bacteriophage infection cycle, see Figure 2.19.

1.1.2 The structure of DNA
The names of James Watson and Francis Crick are so closely linked with DNA
that it is easy to forget that, when they began their collaboration in October
1951, the detailed structure of the DNA polymer was already known. Their
contribution was not to determine the structure of DNA per se, but to show
that in living cells two DNA chains are intertwined to form the double helix.
First, therefore, we should examine what Watson and Crick knew before they
began their work.

Nucleotides and polynucleotides
DNA is a linear, unbranched polymer in which the monomeric subunits are
four chemically distinct nucleotides that can be linked together in any order
in chains hundreds, thousands, or even millions of units in length. Each
nucleotide in a DNA polymer is made up of three components (Figure 1.4):
G

2¢¢-Deoxyribose, which is a pentose, a type of sugar composed of five carbon atoms. These five carbons are numbered 1¢ (spoken as “one-prime”), 2¢,
and so on. The name “2¢-deoxyribose” indicates that this particular sugar is
a derivative of ribose, one in which the hydroxyl (–OH) group attached to
the 2¢-carbon of ribose has been replaced by a hydrogen (–H) group.

G

A nitrogenous base, one of cytosine, thymine (single-ring pyrimidines),
adenine, or guanine (double-ring purines). The base is attached to the 1¢carbon of the sugar by a b-N-glycosidic bond attached to nitrogen number one of the pyrimidine or number nine of the purine.

G

A phosphate group, comprising one, two, or three linked phosphate
units attached to the 5¢-carbon of the sugar. The phosphates are designated a, b, and g, with the a-phosphate being the one directly attached to
the sugar.

A molecule made up of just the sugar and base is called a nucleoside; addition of the phosphates converts this to a nucleotide. Although cells contain
nucleotides with one, two, or three phosphate groups, only the nucleoside
triphosphates act as substrates for DNA synthesis. The full chemical names of
the four nucleotides that polymerize to make DNA are:

The abbreviations of these four nucleotides are dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP,
respectively, or when referring to a DNA sequence, A, C, G, and T, respectively.
In a polynucleotide, individual nucleotides are linked together by phosphodiester bonds between their 5¢- and 3¢-carbons (Figure 1.5). From the structure
of this linkage we can see that the polymerization reaction (Figure 1.6)
involves removal of the two outer phosphates (the b- and g-phosphates) from
one nucleotide and replacement of the hydroxyl group attached to the 3¢-carbon of the second nucleotide. Note that the two ends of the polynucleotide are
chemically distinct, one having an unreacted triphosphate group attached to
the 5¢-carbon (the 5¢¢ or 5¢¢-P terminus), and the other having an unreacted
hydroxyl attached to the 3¢-carbon (the 3¢¢ or 3¢¢-OH terminus). This means that
the polynucleotide has a chemical direction, expressed as either 5¢Æ3¢ (down
in Figure 1.5) or 3¢Æ5¢ (up in Figure 1.5). An important consequence of the
polarity of the phosphodiester bond is that the chemical reaction needed to
extend a DNA polymer in the 5¢Æ3¢ direction is different to that needed to
make a 3¢Æ5¢ extension. All natural DNA polymerase enzymes are only able to
carry out 5¢Æ3¢ synthesis, which adds significant complications to the process
by which double-stranded DNA is replicated (Section 15.2).

The evidence that led to the double helix
In the years before 1950, various lines of evidence had shown that cellular
DNA molecules are comprised of two or more polynucleotides assembled
together in some way. The possibility that unraveling the nature of this
assembly might provide insights into how genes work prompted Watson and
Crick, among others, to try to solve the structure. According to Watson in his
book The Double Helix, their work was a desperate race against the famous
American biochemist, Linus Pauling, who initially proposed an incorrect
triple helix model, giving Watson and Crick the time they needed to complete

the double helix structure. It is now difficult to separate fact from fiction,
especially regarding the part played by Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray diffraction studies provided the bulk of the experimental data in support of the
double helix and who was herself very close to solving the structure. The one
thing that is clear is that the double helix, discovered by Watson and Crick on
Saturday 7 March 1953, was the single most important breakthrough in biology during the twentieth century.
Watson and Crick used four types of information to deduce the double helix
structure:
G

Biophysical data of various kinds. The water content of DNA fibers was particularly important because it enabled the density of the DNA in a fiber to
be estimated. The number of strands in the helix and the spacing between
the nucleotides had to be compatible with the fiber density. Pauling’s triple
helix model was based on an incorrect density measurement that suggested
that the DNA molecule was more closely packed than it actually is.

produced by Rosalind Franklin and which revealed the helical nature of
the structure and indicated some of the key dimensions within the helix.

The base ratios, which had been discovered by Erwin Chargaff of
Columbia University, New York. Chargaff carried out a lengthy series of
chromatographic studies of DNA samples from various sources and
showed that, although the values are different in different organisms, the
amount of adenine is always the same as the amount of thymine, and the
amount of guanine equals the amount of cytosine (Figure 1.7). These base
ratios led to the base-pairing rules, which were the key to the discovery of
the double helix structure.

Purify the DNA

Model building, which was the only major technique that Watson and
Crick performed themselves. Scale models of possible DNA structures
enabled the relative positioning of the various atoms to be checked, to
ensure that pairs that formed bonds were not too far apart, and that other
atoms were not so close together as to interfere with one another.

The key features of the double helix
The double helix is right-handed, which means that if it were a spiral staircase
and you were climbing upwards then the rail on the outside of the staircase
would be on your right-hand side. The two strands run in opposite directions
(Figure 1.8A). The helix is stabilized by two types of chemical interaction:
G

G

Base pairing between the two strands involves the formation of hydrogen
bonds between an adenine on one strand and a thymine on the other
strand, or between a cytosine and a guanine (Figure 1.8B). Hydrogen bonds
are weak electrostatic attractions between an electronegative atom (such as
oxygen or nitrogen) and a hydrogen atom attached to a second electronegative atom. Hydrogen bonds are longer than covalent bonds and are much
weaker, typical bond energies being 1–10 kcal mol–1 at 25˚C, compared
with up to 90 kcal mol–1 for a covalent bond. As well as their role in the
DNA double helix, hydrogen bonds stabilize protein secondary structures.
The two base-pair combinations—A base-paired with T, and G base-paired
with C—explain the base ratios discovered by Chargaff. These are the only
pairs that are permissible, partly because of the geometries of the
nucleotide bases and the relative positions of the atoms that are able to participate in hydrogen bonds, and partly because the pair must be between a
purine and a pyrimidine: a purine–purine pair would be too big to fit within
the helix, and a pyrimidine–pyrimidine pair would be too small.
p interactions, involves hydrophobic
Base stacking, sometimes called p–p
interactions between adjacent base pairs and adds stability to the double
helix once the strands have been brought together by base pairing. These
hydrophobic interactions arise because the hydrogen-bonded structure
of water forces hydrophobic groups into the internal parts of a molecule.

Both base pairing and base stacking are important in holding the two polynucleotides together, but base pairing has added significance because of its biological implications. The limitation that A can only base-pair with T, and G can
only base-pair with C, means that DNA replication can result in perfect copies
of a parent molecule through the simple expedient of using the sequences of
the preexisting strands to dictate the sequences of the new strands. This is template-dependent DNA synthesis and it is the system used by all cellular DNA
polymerases (Section 15.2.2). Base pairing therefore enables DNA molecules to

be replicated by a system that is so simple and elegant that as soon as the double helix structure was publicized by Watson and Crick, every biologist became
convinced that genes really are made of DNA.

The double helix has structural flexibility
The double helix described by Watson and Crick, and shown in Figure 1.8A, is
called the B-form of DNA. Its characteristic features lie in its dimensions: a helical diameter of 2.37 nm, a rise of 0.34 nm per base pair, and a pitch (i.e., distance taken up by a complete turn of the helix) of 3.4 nm, this corresponding to
ten base pairs per turn. The DNA in living cells is thought to be predominantly
in this B-form, but it is now clear that genomic DNA molecules are not entirely
uniform in structure. This is mainly because each nucleotide in the helix has
the flexibility to take up slightly different molecular shapes. To adopt these different conformations, the relative positions of the atoms in the nucleotide
must change slightly. There are a number of possibilities but the most important conformational changes involve rotation around the b-N-glycosidic
bond, changing the orientation of the base relative to the sugar, and rotation
around the bond between the 3¢- and 4¢-carbons. Both rotations have a significant effect on the double helix: changing the base orientation influences the

relative positioning of the two polynucleotides, and rotation around the 3¢–4¢
bond affects the conformation of the sugar–phosphate backbone.
Rotations within individual nucleotides therefore lead to major changes in the
overall structure of the helix. It has been recognized since the 1950s that changes
in the dimensions of the double helix occur when fibers containing DNA molecules are exposed to different relative humidities. For example, the modified
version of the double helix called the A-form (Figure 1.9) has a diameter of
2.55 nm, a rise of 0.29 nm per base pair, and a pitch of 3.2 nm, corresponding to
11 base pairs per turn (Table 1.1). Other variations include B¢-, C-, C¢-, C¢¢-, D-,
E- and T-DNAs. All these are right-handed helices like the B-form. A more drastic reorganization is also possible, leading to the left-handed Z-DNA (Figure 1.9),
a slimmer version of the double helix with a diameter of only 1.84 nm.
The bare dimensions of the various forms of the double helix do not reveal
what are probably the most significant differences between them. These
relate not to diameter and pitch, but the extent to which the internal regions
of the helix are accessible from the surface of the structure. As shown in
Figures 1.8 and 1.9, the B-form of DNA does not have an entirely smooth surface: instead, two grooves spiral along the length of the helix. One of these
grooves is relatively wide and deep and is called the major groove; the other
is narrow and less deep and is called the minor groove. A-DNA also has two
grooves (Figure 1.9), but with this conformation the major groove is even
deeper, and the minor groove shallower and broader compared with B-DNA.
Z-DNA is different again, with one groove virtually nonexistent but the other
very narrow and deep. In each form of DNA, part of the internal surface of at
least one of the grooves is formed by chemical groups attached to the
nucleotide bases. In Chapter 11 we will see that expression of the biological
information contained within a genome is mediated by DNA-binding proteins that attach to the double helix and regulate the activity of the genes contained within it. To carry out their function, each DNA-binding protein must
attach at a specific position, near to the gene whose activity it must influence.
This can be achieved, with at least some degree of accuracy, by the protein
reaching down into a groove, within which the DNA sequence can be “read”
without the helix being opened up by breaking the base pairs. A corollary of
this is that a DNA-binding protein whose structure enables it to recognize a
specific nucleotide sequence within B-DNA, for example, might not be able
to recognize that sequence if the DNA has taken up a different conformation.

As we will see in Chapter 11, conformational variations along the length of a
DNA molecule, together with other structural polymorphisms caused by the
nucleotide sequence, could be important in determining the specificity of the
interactions between the genome and its DNA-binding proteins.

1.2 RNA and the Transcriptome
The initial product of genome expression is the transcriptome (see Figure
1.2), the collection of RNA molecules derived from those protein-coding
genes whose biological information is required by the cell at a particular
time. The RNA molecules of the transcriptome, as well as many other RNAs
derived from genes that do not code for proteins, are synthesized by the

Genomes Chapter 1

6/4/06

3:42 pm

Page 15

RNA and the Transcriptome

process called transcription. In this section we will examine the structure of
RNA and then look more closely at the various types of RNA molecule that
are present in living cells.

1.2.1 The structure of RNA
RNA is a polynucleotide similar to DNA but with two important chemical differences (Figure 1.10). First, the sugar in an RNA nucleotide is ribose and, second, RNA contains uracil instead of thymine. The four nucleotide substrates
for synthesis of RNA are therefore:
G

Adenosine 5¢-triphosphate.

G

Cytidine 5¢-triphosphate.

G

Guanosine 5¢-triphosphate.

G

Uridine 5¢-triphosphate.

These nucleotides are abbreviated to ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, or A, C, G, and
U, respectively.
As with DNA, RNA polynucleotides contain 3¢–5¢ phosphodiester bonds, but
these phosphodiester bonds are less stable than those in a DNA polynucleotide because of the indirect effect of the hydroxyl group at the 2¢-position
of the sugar. RNA molecules are rarely more than a few thousand nucleotides
in length, and although many form intramolecular base pairs (for example,
see Figure 13.2), most are single- rather than double-stranded.
The enzymes responsible for transcription of DNA into RNA are called DNAdependent RNA polymerases. The name indicates that the enzymatic reaction that they catalyze results in polymerization of RNA from ribonucleotides
and occurs in a DNA-dependent manner, meaning that the sequence of
nucleotides in a DNA template dictates the sequence of nucleotides in the
RNA that is made (Figure 1.11). It is permissible to shorten the enzyme name
to RNA polymerase, as the context in which the name is used means that
there is rarely confusion with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases that are
involved in replication and expression of some virus genomes. The chemical
basis of the template-dependent synthesis of RNA is equivalent to that shown
for the synthesis of DNA in Figure 1.6. Ribonucleotides are added one after
another to the growing 3¢ end of the RNA transcript, the identity of each
nucleotide being specified by the base-pairing rules: A base-pairs with T or U;
G base-pairs with C. During each nucleotide addition, the b- and g-phosphates are removed from the incoming nucleotide, and the hydroxyl group is
removed from the 3¢-carbon of the nucleotide at the end of the chain, precisely the same as for DNA polymerization.

1.2.2 The RNA content of the cell
A typical bacterium contains 0.05–0.10 pg of RNA, making up about 6% of its
total weight. A mammalian cell, being much larger, contains more RNA,
20–30 pg in all, but this represents only 1% of the cell as a whole. The best way
to understand the RNA content of a cell is to divide it into categories and subcategories depending on function. There are several ways of doing this, the
most informative scheme being the one shown in Figure 1.12. The primary
division is between coding RNA and noncoding RNA. The coding RNA comprises the transcriptome and is made up of just one class of molecule, the
messenger RNAs (mRNAs), which are transcripts of protein-coding genes

in the 5¢Æ3¢ direction, reading the DNA in
the 3¢Æ5¢ direction, with the sequence of

and hence are translated into protein in the second stage of genome expression. Messenger RNAs rarely make up more than 4% of the total RNA and are
short-lived, being degraded soon after synthesis. Bacterial mRNAs have halflives of no more than a few minutes, and in eukaryotes most mRNAs are
degraded a few hours after synthesis. This rapid turnover means that the
composition of the transcriptome is not fixed and can quickly be restructured
by changing the rate of synthesis of individual mRNAs.
The second type of RNA is referred to as “noncoding” as these molecules are
not translated into protein. However, a better name is functional RNA, as this
emphasizes that, although not part of the transcriptome, the noncoding
RNAs still have essential roles within the cell. There are several diverse types
of functional RNA, the most important being as follows:
G

Ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are present in all organisms and are usually the
most abundant RNAs in the cell, making up over 80% of the total RNA in
actively dividing bacteria. These molecules are components of ribosomes,
the structures on which protein synthesis takes place (Section 13.2).

G

Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are small molecules that are also involved in protein synthesis and, like rRNA, are found in all organisms. The function of
tRNAs is to carry amino acids to the ribosome and ensure that the amino
acids are linked together in the order specified by the nucleotide sequence
of the mRNA that is being translated (Section 13.1).

G

Small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs; also called U-RNAs because these molecules are rich in uridine nucleotides) are found in the nuclei of eukaryotes.
These molecules are involved in splicing, one of the key steps in the processing events that convert the primary transcripts of protein-coding
genes into mRNAs (Section 12.2.2).

G

Small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) are found in the nucleolar regions of
eukaryotic nuclei. They play a central role in the chemical modification of
rRNA molecules by directing the enzymes that perform the modifications
to the specific nucleotides where alterations, such as addition of a methyl
group, must be carried out (Section 12.2.5).

G

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are small
RNAs that regulate the expression of individual genes (Section 12.2.6).

1.2.3 Processing of precursor RNA
As well as the mature RNAs described above, cells also contain precursor molecules. Many RNAs, especially in eukaryotes, are initially synthesized as
precursor or pre-RNA, which has to be processed before it can carry out its
function. The various processing events, all of which are described in Chapter
12, include the following (Figure 1.13):
G

End-modifications occur during the synthesis of eukaryotic mRNAs,
most of which have a single, unusual nucleotide called a cap attached at
the 5¢ end and a poly(A) tail attached to the 3¢ end.

G

Splicing is the removal of segments from within a precursor RNA. Many
genes, especially in eukaryotes, contain internal segments that contain no
biological information. These are called introns and they are copied along
with the information-containing exons when the gene is transcribed. The
introns are removed from the pre-mRNA by cutting and joining reactions.
Unspliced pre-mRNA forms the nuclear RNA fraction called heterogenous nuclear RNA (hnRNA).

G

Cutting events are particularly important in the processing of rRNAs and
tRNAs, many of which are initially synthesized from transcription units
that specify more than one molecule. The pre-rRNAs and pre-tRNAs must
therefore be cut into pieces to produce the mature RNAs. This type of
processing occurs in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.

G

Chemical modifications are made to rRNAs, tRNAs, and mRNAs. The
rRNAs and tRNAs of all organisms are modified by addition of new chemical groups, these groups being added to specific nucleotides within each
RNA. Chemical modification of mRNA, called RNA editing, occurs in
many eukaryotes.

1.2.4 The transcriptome
Although the transcriptome makes up less than 4% of the total cell RNA, it is
the most significant component because it contains the coding RNAs that are
used in the next stage of genome expression. It is important to note that the
transcriptome is never synthesized de novo. Every cell receives part of its parent’s transcriptome when it is first brought into existence by cell division, and
maintains a transcriptome throughout its lifetime. Even quiescent cells in
bacterial spores or in the seeds of plants have a transcriptome, although
translation of that transcriptome into protein may be completely switched
off. Transcription of individual protein-coding genes does not, therefore,
result in synthesis of the transcriptome but instead maintains the transcriptome by replacing mRNAs that have been degraded, and brings about

changes to the composition of the transcriptome via the switching on and off
of different sets of genes.
Even in the simplest organisms, such as bacteria and yeast, many genes are
active at any one time. Transcriptomes are therefore complex, containing
copies of hundreds, if not thousands, of different mRNAs. Usually each
mRNA makes up only a small fraction of the whole, with the most common
type rarely contributing more than 1% of the total mRNA. Exceptions are
those cells that have highly specialized biochemistries, reflected by transcriptomes in which one or a few mRNAs predominate. Developing wheat seeds
are an example: these synthesize large amounts of the gliadin proteins, which
accumulate in the dormant grain and provide a source of amino acids for the
germinating seedling. Within the developing seeds, the gliadin mRNAs can
make up as much as 30% of the transcriptomes of certain cells.

1.3 Proteins and the Proteome
The second product of genome expression is the proteome (see Figure 1.2),
the cell’s repertoire of proteins, which specifies the nature of the biochemical
reactions that the cell is able to carry out. These proteins are synthesized by
translation of the mRNA molecules that make up the transcriptome.

1.3.1 Protein structure
A protein, like a DNA molecule, is a linear, unbranched polymer. In proteins, the monomeric subunits are called amino acids (Figure 1.14) and the
resulting polymers, or polypeptides, are rarely more than 2000 units in
length. As with DNA, the key features of protein structure were determined
in the first half of the twentieth century, this phase of protein biochemistry
culminating in the 1940s and early 1950s with the elucidation by Pauling
and Corey of the major conformations, or secondary structures, taken up
by polypeptides. In recent years, interest has focused on how these secondary structures combine to produce the complex, three-dimensional shapes
of proteins.

The four levels of protein structure
Proteins are traditionally looked upon as having four distinct levels of structure. These levels are hierarchical, the protein being built up stage-by-stage,
with each level of structure depending on the one below it:

COO+

H3N

C

G

The primary structure of the protein is formed by joining amino acids
into a polypeptide. The amino acids are linked by peptide bonds that are
formed by a condensation reaction between the carboxyl group of one
amino acid and the amino group of a second amino acid (Figure 1.15).
Note that, as with a polynucleotide, the two ends of the polypeptide are
chemically distinct: one has a free amino group and is called the amino,
NH2–, or N terminus; the other has a free carboxyl group and is called the
carboxyl, COOH–, or C terminus. The direction of the polypeptide can
therefore be expressed as either NÆC (left to right in Figure 1.15) or CÆN
(right to left in Figure 1.15).

G

The secondary structure refers to the different conformations that can
be taken up by the polypeptide. The two main types of secondary structure are the a-helix and b-sheet (Figure 1.16). These are stabilized mainly
by hydrogen bonds that form between different amino acids in the

amino acid. All amino acids have the same
general structure, comprising a central
a-carbon attached to a hydrogen atom, a
carboxyl group, an amino group, and an R
group. The R group is different for each
amino acid (see Figure 1.18).

Proteins and the Proteome

G

G

The tertiary structure results from folding the secondary structural components of the polypeptide into a three-dimensional configuration
(Figure 1.17). The tertiary structure is stabilized by various chemical
forces, notably hydrogen bonding between individual amino acids, electrostatic interactions between the R groups of charged amino acids (see
Figure 1.18), and hydrophobic forces, which dictate that amino acids with
nonpolar (“water-hating”) side-groups must be shielded from water by
embedding within the internal regions of the protein. There may also be
covalent linkages called disulfide bridges between cysteine amino acid
residues at various places in the polypeptide.
The quaternary structure involves the association of two or more polypeptides, each folded into its tertiary structure, into a multisubunit protein.
Not all proteins form quaternary structures, but it is a feature of many proteins with complex functions, including several involved in genome expression. Some quaternary structures are held together by disulfide bridges
between the different polypeptides, resulting in stable multisubunit proteins that cannot easily be broken down to the component parts. Other
quaternary structures comprise looser associations of subunits stabilized
by hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects, which means that these
proteins can revert to their component polypeptides, or change their subunit composition, according to the functional requirements of the cell.

The 20 amino acids shown in Figure 1.18 are the ones that are conventionally
looked upon as being specified by the genetic code (Section 1.3.2). They are
therefore the amino acids that are linked together when mRNA molecules are
translated into proteins. However, these 20 amino acids do not, on their own,
represent the limit of the chemical diversity of proteins. The diversity is even
greater because of two factors:
G

At least two additional amino acids—selenocysteine and pyrrolysine
(Figure 1.19)—can be inserted into a polypeptide chain during protein
synthesis, their insertion directed by a modified reading of the genetic
code (Section 13.1.1).

Figure 1.15 In polypeptides, amino acids
are linked by peptide bonds. The drawing
shows the chemical reaction that results in
two amino acids becoming linked together
by a peptide bond. The reaction is called a
condensation because it results in
elimination of water.

(B) β-sheet

Amino acid diversity underlies protein diversity

Amino acid diversity derives from the R group because this part is different in
each amino acid and varies greatly in structure. Proteins are made up from a
set of 20 amino acids (Figure 1.18; Table 1.2). Some of these have R groups
that are small, relatively simple structures, such as a single hydrogen atom (in
the amino acid called glycine) or a methyl group (alanine). Other R groups are
large, complex aromatic side chains (phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine). Most amino acids are uncharged, but two are negatively charged
(aspartic acid and glutamic acid) and three are positively charged (arginine,
histidine, and lysine). Some amino acids are polar (e.g., glycine, serine, and
threonine), others are nonpolar (e.g., alanine, leucine, and valine).

Proteins are functionally diverse because the amino acids from which proteins are made are themselves chemically diverse. Different sequences of
amino acids therefore result in different combinations of chemical reactivities, these combinations dictating not only the overall structure of the resulting protein but also the positioning on the surface of the structure of reactive
groups that determine the chemical properties of the protein.

α-helices

During protein processing, some amino acids are modified by the addition of new chemical groups, for example by acetylation or phosphorylation, or by attachment of large side chains made up of sugar units
(Section 13.3.3).

Proteins therefore have an immense amount of chemical variability, some of this
directly specified by the genome, the remainder arising by protein processing.

1.3.2 The proteome
β-sheet

The proteome comprises all the proteins present in a cell at a particular time.
A “typical” mammalian cell, for example a liver hepatocyte, is thought to contain 10,000–20,000 different proteins, about 8 ¥ 109 individual molecules in all,
representing approximately 0.5 ng of protein or 18%–20% of the total cell
weight. The copy numbers of individual proteins vary enormously, from less
than 20,000 molecules per cell for the rarest types to 100 million copies for the
commonest ones. Any protein that is present at a copy number of greater than
50,000 per cell is considered to be relatively abundant, and in the average
mammalian cell some 2000 proteins fall into this category. When the proteomes of different types of mammalian cell are examined, very few differences

are seen among these abundant proteins, suggesting that most of them are
housekeeping proteins that perform general biochemical activities that occur
in all cells. The proteins that provide the cell with its specialized function are
often quite rare, although there are exceptions, such as the vast amounts of
hemoglobin that are present only in red blood cells.

The link between the transcriptome and the proteome
The flow of information from DNA to RNA by transcription does not provide
any conceptual difficulty. DNA and RNA polynucleotides have very similar
structures and we can easily understand how an RNA copy of a gene can be
made by template-dependent synthesis using the base-pairing rules with
which we are familiar. The second phase of genome expression, during which
the mRNA molecules of the transcriptome direct synthesis of proteins, is less
easy to understand simply by considering the structures of the molecules that
are involved. In the early 1950s, shortly after the double helix structure of
DNA had been discovered, several molecular biologists attempted to devise
ways in which amino acids could attach to mRNAs in an ordered fashion, but
in all of these schemes at least some of the bonds had to be shorter or longer
than was possible according to the laws of physical chemistry, and each idea
was quietly dropped. Eventually, in 1957, Francis Crick cut a way through the
confusion by predicting the existence of an adaptor molecule that would

form a bridge between the mRNA and the polypeptide being synthesized.
Soon afterwards it was realized that the tRNAs are these adaptor molecules,
and once this fact had been established, a detailed understanding of the
mechanism by which proteins are synthesized was quickly built up. We will
examine this process in Section 13.1.
The other aspect of protein synthesis that interested molecular biologists in
the 1950s was the informational problem. This refers to the second important component of the link between the transcriptome and proteome: the
genetic code, which specifies how the nucleotide sequence of an mRNA is
translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein. It was recognized in the
1950s that a triplet genetic code—one in which each codeword, or codon,
comprises three nucleotides—is required to account for all 20 amino acids
found in proteins. A two-letter code would have only 42 = 16 codons, which is
not enough to account for all 20 amino acids, whereas a three-letter code
would give 43 = 64 codons. The genetic code was worked out in the 1960s,
partly by analysis of polypeptides arising from translation of artificial mRNAs
of known or predictable sequence in cell-free systems, and partly by determining which amino acids associated with which RNA sequences in an assay
based on purified ribosomes. When this work was completed, it was realized
that the 64 codons fall into groups, the members of each group coding for the
same amino acid (Figure 1.20). Only tryptophan and methionine have just a
single codon each: all other amino acids are coded by two, three, four, or six
codons. This feature of the code is called degeneracy. The code also has four
punctuation codons, which indicate the points within an mRNA where
translation of the nucleotide sequence should start and finish (Figure 1.21).
The initiation codon is usually 5¢–AUG–3¢, which also specifies methionine
(so most newly synthesized polypeptides start with methionine), although
with a few mRNAs other codons such as 5¢–GUG–3¢ and 5¢–UUG–3¢ are used.
The three termination codons are 5¢–UAG–3¢, 5¢–UAA–3¢, and 5¢–UGA–3¢.

The genetic code is not universal
It was originally thought that the genetic code must be the same in all organisms. The argument was that, once established, it would be impossible for the
code to change because giving a new meaning to any single codon would
result in widespread disruption of the amino acid sequences of proteins. This
reasoning seems sound, so it is surprising that, in reality, the genetic code is
not universal. The code shown in Figure 1.20 holds for the vast majority of
genes in the vast majority of organisms, but deviations are widespread. In particular, mitochondrial genomes often use a nonstandard code (Table 1.3). This
was first discovered in 1979 by Frederick Sanger’s group in Cambridge, UK,
who found that several human mitochondrial mRNAs contain the sequence
5¢–UGA–3¢, which normally codes for termination, at internal positions where
protein synthesis was not expected to stop. Comparisons with the amino acid
sequences of the proteins coded by these mRNAs showed that 5¢–UGA–3¢ is a
tryptophan codon in human mitochondria, and that this is just one of four
code deviations in this particular genetic system. Mitochondrial genes in
other organisms also display code deviations, although at least one of these—
the use of 5¢–CGG–3¢ as a tryptophan codon in plant mitochondria—is probably corrected by RNA editing (Section 12.2.5) before translation occurs.
Nonstandard codes are also known for the nuclear genomes of lower eukaryotes. Often a modification is restricted to just a small group of organisms and

frequently it involves reassignment of the termination codons (Table 1.3).
Modifications are less common among prokaryotes, but one example is
known in Mycoplasma species. A more important type of code variation is
context-dependent codon reassignment, which occurs when the protein to
be synthesized contains either selenocysteine or pyrrolysine. Proteins containing pyrrolysine are rare, and are probably only present in the group of
prokaryotes called the archaea (Chapter 8), but selenoproteins are widespread in many organisms, one example being the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which helps protect the cells of humans and other mammals against
oxidative damage. Selenocysteine is coded by 5¢–UGA–3¢ and pyrrolysine by
5¢–UAG–3¢. These codons therefore have a dual meaning because they are
still used as termination codons in the organisms concerned (Table 1.3). A
5¢–UGA–3¢ codon that specifies selenocysteine is distinguished from true termination codons by the presence of a hairpin loop structure in the mRNA,
positioned just downstream of the selenocysteine codon in prokaryotes, and
in the 3¢ untranslated region (i.e., the part of the mRNA after the termination
codon) in eukaryotes. Recognition of the selenocysteine codon requires
interaction between the hairpin structure and a special protein that is
involved in translation of these mRNAs. A similar system probably operates
for specifying pyrrolysine.

The link between the proteome and the biochemistry of the cell
The biological information encoded by the genome finds its final expression
in a protein whose biological properties are determined by its folded structure and by the spatial arrangement of chemical groups on its surface. By
specifying proteins of different types, the genome is able to construct and
maintain a proteome whose overall biological properties form the underlying
basis of life. The proteome can play this role because of the huge diversity of
protein structures that can be formed, the diversity enabling proteins to carry
out a variety of biological functions. These functions include the following:

Biochemical catalysis is the role of the special type of proteins called

Structure, which at the cellular level is determined by the proteins that
make up the cytoskeleton, is also the primary function of some extracellular proteins. An example is collagen, which is an important component of

Transport of materials around the body is an important protein activity:
for example, hemoglobin transports oxygen in the bloodstream, and
serum albumin transports fatty acids.

G

Regulation of cellular processes is mediated by signaling proteins such as
STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription, Section 14.1.2),
and by proteins such as activators that bind to the genome and influence
the expression levels of individual genes and groups of genes (Section
11.3). The activities of groups of cells are regulated and coordinated by

Genomes Chapter 1

extracellular hormones and cytokines, many of which are proteins (e.g.,
insulin, the hormone that controls blood sugar levels, and the interleukins,
a group of cytokines that regulate cell division and differentiation).
G

Protection of the body and of individual cells is the function of a range of
proteins, including the antibodies and those proteins involved in the
blood-clotting response.

G

Storage functions are performed by proteins such as ferritin, which acts as
an iron store in the liver, and the gliadins, which store amino acids in dormant wheat seeds.

This multiplicity of protein function provides the proteome with its ability to
convert the blueprint contained in the genome into the essential features of
the life process.

Summary
The genome is the store of biological information possessed by every organism
on the planet. The vast majority of genomes are made of DNA, the few exceptions being those viruses that have RNA genomes. Genome expression is the
process by which the information contained in the genome is released to the
cell. The first product of genome expression is the transcriptome, the collection
of RNAs derived from the protein-coding genes that are active in the cell at a
particular time. The second product is the proteome, the cell’s repertoire of
proteins that specify the nature of the biochemical reactions that the cell is able
to carry out. Experimental evidence showing that genes are made of DNA was
first obtained between 1945 and 1952, but it was the discovery of the double
helix structure by Watson and Crick in 1953 that convinced biologists that DNA
is, indeed, the genetic material. A DNA polynucleotide is an unbranched polymer made up of multiple copies of four chemically different nucleotides. In the
double helix, two polynucleotides are wound around one another, with the
nucleotide bases on the inside of the molecule. The polynucleotides are linked
by hydrogen bonding between the bases, with A always base-paired to T, and G
always base-paired to C. RNA is also a polynucleotide but the individual
nucleotides have different structures compared with those found in DNA, and
RNA is usually single-stranded. DNA-dependent RNA polymerases are responsible for copying genes into RNA by the process called transcription, which
results in synthesis not only of the transcriptome but also of a range of functional RNA molecules, which do not code for proteins but still play vital roles in
the cell. Many RNAs are initially synthesized as precursor molecules that are
processed by cutting and joining reactions, and by chemical modifications, to
give the mature forms. Proteins are also unbranched polymers, but in these the
units are amino acids linked by peptide bonds. The amino acid sequence is the
primary structure of a protein. The higher levels of structure—secondary, tertiary, and quaternary—are formed by folding the primary structure into threedimensional conformations and by association of individual polypeptides into
multiprotein structures. Proteins are functionally diverse because individual
amino acids have different chemical properties that, when combined in different ways, result in proteins with a range of chemical features. Proteins are synthesized by translation of mRNAs, with the rules of the genetic code specifying
which triplet of nucleotides codes for which amino acid. The genetic code is not
universal, variations occurring in mitochondria and in lower eukaryotes, and
some codons can have two different meanings in a single gene.

Virtually everything we know about genomes and genome expression has
been discovered by scientific research: theoretical studies have played very
little role in this or any other area of molecular and cell biology. It is possible
to learn “facts” about genomes without knowing very much about how those
facts were obtained, but in order to gain a real understanding of the subject
we must examine in detail the techniques and scientific approaches that have
been used to study genomes. The next five chapters cover these research
methods. First, we examine the techniques, centered on DNA cloning and the

polymerase chain reaction, that are used to study DNA molecules. These
techniques are very effective with short segments of DNA, including individual genes, enabling a wealth of information to be obtained at this level.
Chapter 3 moves on to the methods developed to construct maps of genomes,
and describes how the techniques of genetic mapping, first developed almost
a century ago, have been supplemented with complementary methods for
physical mapping of genomes. Chapter 4 makes the link between mapping
and sequencing, and shows that although a map can be a valuable aid to
assembly of a long DNA sequence, mapping is not always an essential prerequisite to genome sequencing. In Chapter 5, we look at the various approaches
that are used to understand a genome sequence, and in Chapter 6 we examine the methods used to study genome expression. As you read Chapter 6 you
will begin to appreciate that understanding how a genome specifies the biochemical capability of a living cell is one of the major research challenges of
modern biology.
The toolkit of techniques used by molecular biologists to study DNA molecules was assembled during the 1970s and 1980s. Before then, the only way in
which individual genes could be studied was by classical genetics, using the
procedures that we will meet in Chapter 3. The development of more direct
methods for studying DNA was stimulated by breakthroughs in biochemical
research that, in the early 1970s, provided molecular biologists with enzymes
that could be used to manipulate DNA molecules in the test tube. These
enzymes occur naturally in living cells and are involved in processes such as
DNA replication, repair, and recombination, which we will meet in Chapters
15, 16 and 17. In order to determine the functions of these enzymes, many of
them were purified and the reactions that they catalyze studied. Molecular
biologists then adopted the pure enzymes as tools for manipulating DNA
molecules in predetermined ways, using them to make copies of DNA molecules, to cut DNA molecules into shorter fragments, and to join them together
again in combinations that do not exist in nature (Figure 2.1). These manipulations form the basis of recombinant DNA technology, in which new or
“recombinant” DNA molecules are constructed from pieces of naturally
occurring chromosomes and plasmids.
Recombinant DNA methodology led to the development of DNA cloning, or
gene cloning, in which short DNA fragments, possibly containing a single
gene, are inserted into a plasmid or virus chromosome and then replicated in
a bacterial or eukaryotic host (Figure 2.2). We will examine exactly how gene
cloning is performed, and the reasons why this technique resulted in a revolution in molecular biology, in Section 2.2.

Enzymes for DNA Manipulation

Gene cloning was well established by the end of the 1970s. The next major
technical breakthrough came in the mid 1980s when the polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) was invented. PCR is not a complicated technique—all that it
achieves is the repeated copying of a short segment of a DNA molecule (Figure
2.3)—but it has become immensely important in many areas of biological
research, not least the study of genomes. PCR is covered in detail in Section 2.3.

2.1 Enzymes for DNA Manipulation
Recombinant DNA technology was one of the main factors that contributed
to the rapid advance in knowledge concerning gene expression that occurred
during the 1970s and 1980s. The basis of recombinant DNA technology is the
ability to manipulate DNA molecules in the test tube. This, in turn, depends
on the availability of purified enzymes whose activities are known and can be
controlled, and which can therefore be used to make specified changes to the
DNA molecules that are being manipulated. The enzymes available to the
molecular biologist fall into four broad categories:

Ligases (Section 2.1.3), which join DNA molecules together by synthesizing phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides at the ends of two different molecules, or at the two ends of a single molecule (Figure 2.4C).

End-modification enzymes (Section 2.1.4), which make changes to the
ends of DNA molecules, adding an important dimension to the design of
ligation experiments, and providing one means of labeling DNA molecules with radioactive and other markers (Technical Note 2.1).

2.1.1 DNA polymerases
Many of the techniques used to study DNA depend on the synthesis of DNA
copies of all or part of existing DNA or RNA molecules. This is an essential
requirement for PCR (Section 2.3), DNA sequencing (Section 4.1), DNA labeling (Technical Note 2.1), and many other procedures that are central to
molecular biology research. An enzyme that synthesizes DNA is called a DNA
polymerase, and one that copies an existing DNA or RNA molecule is called
a template-dependent DNA polymerase.

Technical Note 2.1 DNA labeling
Attachment of radioactive, fluorescent, or other types of marker to DNA molecules
DNA labeling is a central part of many molecular biology
procedures, including Southern hybridization (Section
2.1.2), fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH; Section
3.3.2), and DNA sequencing (Section 4.1). It enables the
location of a particular DNA molecule—on a nitrocellulose
or nylon membrane, in a chromosome, or in a gel—to be
determined by detecting the signal emitted by the marker.
Labeled RNA molecules are also used in some applications
(Technical Note 5.1).
Radioactive markers are frequently used for labeling DNA
molecules. Nucleotides can be synthesized in which one of
the phosphorus atoms is replaced with 32P or 33P, one of
the oxygen atoms in the phosphate group is replaced with
35S, or one or more of the hydrogen atoms is replaced with
3H (see Figure 1.4). Radioactive nucleotides still act as substrates for DNA polymerases and so are incorporated into a
DNA molecule by any strand-synthesis reaction catalyzed
by a DNA polymerase. Labeled nucleotides or individual
phosphate groups can also be attached to one or both
ends of a DNA molecule by the reactions catalyzed by T4
polynucleotide kinase or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Section 2.1.4). The radioactive signal can be
detected by scintillation counting, but for most molecular
biology applications positional information is needed, so
detection is by exposure of an X-ray-sensitive film (autoradiography: see Figure 2.11 for an example) or a radiation-

sensitive phosphorescent screen (phosphorimaging). The
choice between the various radioactive labels depends on
the requirements of the procedure. High sensitivity is possible with 32P because this isotope has a high emission
energy, but sensitivity is accompanied by low resolution
because of signal scattering. Low-emission isotopes such as
35S or 3H give less sensitivity but greater resolution.
Health and environmental issues have meant that radioactive markers have become less popular in recent years and
for many procedures they are now largely superseded by
nonradioactive alternatives. The most useful of these are
fluorescent markers, which are central components of
techniques such as FISH (Section 3.3.2) and DNA
sequencing (Section 4.1.1). Fluorescent labels with various emission wavelengths (i.e., of different colors) are
incorporated into nucleotides or attached directly to DNA
molecules, and are detected with a suitable film, by fluorescence microscopy, or with a fluorescence detector.
Other types of nonradioactive labeling make use of chemiluminescent emissions, but these have the disadvantage
that the signal is not generated directly by the label, but
instead must be “developed” by treatment of the labeled
molecule with chemicals. A popular method involves labeling the DNA with the enzyme alkaline phosphatase, which
is detected by applying dioxetane, which the enzyme
dephosphorylates to produce the chemiluminescence.

Enzymes for DNA Manipulation

The mode of action of a template-dependent DNA polymerase
A template-dependent DNA polymerase makes a new DNA polynucleotide
whose sequence is dictated, via the base-pairing rules, by the sequence of
nucleotides in the DNA or RNA molecule that is being copied (Figure 2.5). The
new polynucleotide is always synthesized in the 5¢Æ3¢ direction: DNA polymerases that make DNA in the other direction are unknown in nature.
An important feature of template-dependent DNA synthesis is that a DNA
polymerase is unable to use an entirely single-stranded molecule as the template. In order to initiate DNA synthesis there must be a short, doublestranded region to provide a 3¢ end onto which the enzyme will add new
nucleotides (Figure 2.6A). The way in which this requirement is met in living
cells when the genome is replicated is described in Chapter 15. In the test
tube, a DNA-copying reaction is initiated by attaching to the template a short,
synthetic oligonucleotide, usually about 20 nucleotides in length, which acts
as a primer for DNA synthesis. At first glance, the need for a primer might
appear to be an undesired complication in the use of DNA polymerases in
recombinant DNA technology, but nothing could be further from the truth.
Because annealing of the primer to the template depends on complementary
base pairing, the position within the template molecule at which DNA copying is initiated can be specified by synthesizing a primer with the appropriate
nucleotide sequence (Figure 2.6B). A short, specific segment of a much longer
template molecule can therefore be copied, which is much more valuable
than the random copying that would occur if DNA synthesis did not need to
be primed. You will fully appreciate the importance of priming when we deal
with PCR in Section 2.3.

nucleotides are added on to the 3¢ end of
the growing polynucleotide, the sequence
of this new polynucleotide being
determined by the sequence of the
template DNA. Compare with the process
of transcription (DNA-dependent RNA
synthesis) shown in Figure 1.11.

A second general feature of template-dependent DNA polymerases is that
many of these enzymes are multifunctional, being able to degrade DNA molecules as well as synthesize them. This is a reflection of the way in which DNA
polymerases act in the cell during genome replication (Section 15.2). As well
as their 5¢Æ3¢ DNA synthesis capability, DNA polymerases can also have one
or both of the following exonuclease activities (Figure 2.7):
G

A 3¢¢Æ5¢¢ exonuclease activity enables the enzyme to remove nucleotides
from the 3¢ end of the strand that it has just synthesized. This is called the
proofreading activity because it allows the polymerase to correct errors by
removing a nucleotide that has been inserted incorrectly.

Figure 2.7 The DNA synthesis and
exonuclease activities of DNA
polymerases. All DNA polymerases can
make DNA, and many also have one or
both of the exonuclease activities.

Several of the template-dependent DNA polymerases that are used in molecular biology research (Table 2.1) are versions of the Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I enzyme, which plays a central role in replication of this bacterium’s
genome (Section 15.2). This enzyme, sometimes called the Kornberg polymerase, after its discoverer Arthur Kornberg, has both the 3¢Æ5¢ and 5¢Æ3¢
exonuclease activities, which limits its usefulness in DNA manipulation. Its
main application is in DNA labeling (Technical Note 2.1).
Of the two exonuclease activities, it is the 5¢Æ3¢ version that causes most
problems when a DNA polymerase is used to manipulate molecules in the
test tube. This is because an enzyme that possesses this activity is able to
remove nucleotides from the 5¢ ends of polynucleotides that have just been
synthesized (Figure 2.8). It is unlikely that the polynucleotides will be completely degraded, because the polymerase function is usually much more
active than the exonuclease function, but some techniques will not work if
the 5¢ ends of the new polynucleotides are shortened in any way. In particular, DNA sequencing is based on synthesis of new polynucleotides, all of
which share exactly the same 5¢ end, marked by the primer used to initiate
the sequencing reactions. If any “nibbling” of the 5¢ ends occurs, then it is
impossible to determine the correct DNA sequence. When DNA sequencing
was first introduced in the late 1970s, it made use of a modified version of the
Kornberg enzyme called the Klenow polymerase. The Klenow polymerase
was initially prepared by cutting the natural E. coli DNA polymerase I enzyme
into two segments using a protease. One of these segments retained the polymerase and 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activities, but lacked the 5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease
function of the untreated enzyme. The enzyme is still often called the Klenow
fragment, in memory of this old method of preparation, but nowadays it is
almost always prepared from E. coli cells whose polymerase gene has been
engineered so that the resulting enzyme has the desired properties. But in
fact the Klenow polymerase is now rarely used in sequencing and has its
major application in DNA labeling (see Technical Note 2.1). This is because an
enzyme called Sequenase (see Table 2.1), which has superior properties as far
as sequencing is concerned, was developed in the 1980s. We will return to the

features of Sequenase, and why they make the enzyme ideal for sequencing,
in Section 4.1.1.
The E. coli DNA polymerase I enzyme has an optimum reaction temperature
of 37˚C, this being the usual temperature of the natural environment of the
bacterium, inside the intestines of mammals such as humans. Test-tube
reactions with either the Kornberg or Klenow polymerases, and with
Sequenase, are therefore incubated at 37˚C, and terminated by raising the
temperature to 75˚C or above, which causes the protein to unfold, or denature, destroying its enzymatic activity. This regimen is perfectly adequate for
most molecular biology techniques, but for reasons that will become clear in
Section 2.3, PCR requires a thermostable DNA polymerase—one that is able
to function at temperatures much higher than 37˚C. Suitable enzymes can
be obtained from bacteria such as Thermus aquaticus, which live in hot
springs at temperatures up to 95˚C, and whose DNA polymerase I enzyme
has an optimum working temperature of 72˚C. The biochemical basis of protein thermostability is not fully understood, but probably centers on structural features that reduce the amount of protein unfolding that occurs at elevated temperatures.

One additional type of DNA polymerase is important in molecular biology
research. This is reverse transcriptase, which is an RNA-dependent DNA
polymerase and so makes DNA copies of RNA rather than DNA templates.
Reverse transcriptases are involved in the replication cycles of retroviruses
(Section 9.1.2), including the human immunodeficiency viruses that cause
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, these viruses having RNA
genomes that are copied into DNA after infection of the host. In the test tube,
a reverse transcriptase can be used to make DNA copies of mRNA molecules.
These copies are called complementary DNAs (cDNAs). Their synthesis is
important in some types of gene cloning and in techniques used to map the
regions of a genome that specify particular mRNAs (Section 5.1.2).

2.1.2 Nucleases
A variety of nucleases have found applications in recombinant DNA technology (Table 2.2). Some nucleases have a broad range of activities but most are
either exonucleases, removing nucleotides from the ends of DNA and/or
RNA molecules, or endonucleases, making cuts at internal phosphodiester
bonds. Some nucleases are specific for DNA and some for RNA, some work
only on double-stranded DNA and others only on single-stranded DNA, and

some are not fussy what they work on. We will encounter various examples of
nucleases in later chapters when we deal with the techniques in which they
are used. Only one type of nuclease will be considered in detail here: the
restriction endonucleases, which play a central role in all aspects of recombinant DNA technology.

Type I or III
restriction endonuclease
DNA

Restriction endonucleases enable DNA molecules to be cut at
defined positions
A restriction endonuclease is an enzyme that binds to a DNA molecule at a
specific sequence and makes a double-stranded cut at or near that sequence.
Because of the sequence specificity, the positions of cuts within a DNA molecule can be predicted, assuming that the DNA sequence is known, enabling
defined segments to be excised from a larger molecule. This ability underlies
gene cloning and all other aspects of recombinant DNA technology in which
DNA fragments of known sequence are required.

Type II
restriction endonuclease

All cuts at the same position

Figure 2.9 Cuts produced by restriction
endonucleases. In the top part of the
diagram, the DNA is cut by a Type I or Type
III restriction endonuclease. The cuts are
made in slightly different positions relative
to the recognition sequence, so the
resulting fragments have different lengths. In
the lower part of the diagram, a Type II
enzyme is used. Each molecule is cut at
exactly the same position to give exactly the
same pair of fragments.

There are three types of restriction endonuclease. With Types I and III, there
is no strict control over the position of the cut relative to the specific sequence
in the DNA molecule that is recognized by the enzyme. These enzymes are
therefore less useful because the sequences of the resulting fragments are not
precisely known. Type II enzymes do not suffer from this disadvantage
because the cut is always at the same place, either within the recognition
sequence or very close to it (Figure 2.9). For example, the Type II enzyme
called EcoRI (isolated from E. coli) cuts DNA only at the hexanucleotide
5¢–GAATTC–3¢. Digestion of DNA with a Type II enzyme therefore gives a
reproducible set of fragments whose sequences are predictable if the

sequence of the target DNA molecule is known. Over 2500 Type II enzymes
have been isolated, and more than 300 are available for use in the laboratory.
Many enzymes have hexanucleotide target sites, but others recognize shorter
or longer sequences (Table 2.3). There are also examples of enzymes with
degenerate recognition sequences, meaning that they cut DNA at any of a
family of related sites. HinfI (from Haemophilus influenzae), for example, recognizes 5¢–GANTC–3¢, where “N” is any nucleotide, and so cuts at
5¢–GAATC–3¢, 5¢–GATTC–3¢, 5¢–GAGTC–3¢, and 5¢–GACTC–3¢. Most enzymes
cut within the recognition sequence, but a few, such as BsrBI, cut at a specified position outside of this sequence.
Restriction enzymes cut DNA in two different ways. Many make a simple
double-stranded cut, giving a blunt or flush end, but others cut the two DNA
strands at different positions, usually two or four nucleotides apart, so that
the resulting DNA fragments have short, single-stranded overhangs at each
end. These are called sticky or cohesive ends because base-pairing between
them can stick the DNA molecule back together again (Figure 2.10A). Some
sticky-end cutters give 5¢ overhangs (e.g., Sau3AI, HinfI) whereas others leave
3¢ overhangs (e.g., PstI) (Figure 2.10B). One feature that is particularly important in recombinant DNA technology is that some pairs of restriction
enzymes have different recognition sequences but give the same sticky ends,
examples being Sau3AI and BamHI, which both give a 5¢–GATC–3¢ sticky end,
even though Sau3AI has a four-base-pair recognition sequence and BamHI
recognizes a six-base-pair sequence (Figure 2.10C).

Technical Note 2.2 Agarose gel electrophoresis
Separation of DNA molecules of different lengths
Gel electrophoresis is the standard method for separating
DNA molecules of different lengths. It has many applications in size analysis of DNA fragments and can also be
used to separate RNA molecules (see Technical Note 5.1).
Electrophoresis is the movement of charged molecules in
an electric field: negatively charged molecules migrate
towards the positive electrode, and positively charged molecules migrate towards the negative electrode. The technique was originally carried out in aqueous solution, in
which the predominant factors influencing migration rate
are the shape of a molecule and its electric charge. This is
not particularly useful for DNA separations because most
DNA molecules are the same shape (linear) and although
the charge of a DNA molecule is dependent on its length,
the differences in charge are not sufficient to result in effective separation. The situation is different when electrophoresis is carried out in a gel, because now shape and
charge are less important and molecular length is the critical determinant of migration rate. This is because the gel is
a network of pores through which the DNA molecules have
to travel to reach the positive electrode. Shorter molecules
are less impeded by the pores than are longer molecules
and so move through the gel more quickly. Molecules of
different lengths therefore form bands in the gel.
Two types of gel are used in molecular biology: agarose
gels, as described here, and polyacrylamide gels, which
are covered in Technical Note 4.1. Agarose is a polysaccharide that forms gels with pores ranging from 100 nm to
300 nm in diameter, the size depending on the concentration of agarose in the gel. Gel concentration therefore

determines the range of DNA fragments that can be separated. The separation range is also affected by the electroendosmosis (EEO) value of the agarose, this being a
measure of the amount of bound sulfate and pyruvate
anions. The greater the EEO, the slower the migration rate
for a negatively charged molecule such as DNA.
An agarose gel is prepared by mixing the appropriate
amount of agarose powder in a buffer solution, heating to
dissolve the agarose, and then pouring the molten gel
onto a Perspex plate with tape around the sides to prevent
spillage. A comb is placed in the gel to form wells for the
samples. The gel is allowed to set and the electrophoresis
then carried out with the gel submerged under buffer. In
order to follow the progress of the electrophoresis, one or
two dyes of known migration rates are added to the DNA
samples before loading. The bands of DNA are visualized
by soaking the gel in ethidium bromide solution, this compound intercalating between DNA base pairs and fluorescing when activated with ultraviolet radiation (Figure T2.1).
Depending on the concentration of agarose in the gel,
fragments between 100 base pairs (bp) and 50 kb in
length can be separated into sharp bands after electrophoresis (Figure T2.2). For example, a 0.3% gel can be
used for molecules between 5 kb and 50 kb, and a 5%
gel for molecules 100–500 bp in length. Fragments less
than 150 bp long can be separated in a 4% or 5%
agarose gel, making it possible to distinguish bands representing molecules that differ in size by just a single
nucleotide. With larger fragments, however, it is not always
possible to separate molecules of similar size, even in gels
of lower agarose concentration.

Examining the results of a restriction digest
After treatment with a restriction endonuclease, the resulting DNA fragments
can be examined by agarose gel electrophoresis (Technical Note 2.2) to determine their sizes. If the starting DNA is a relatively short molecule, and twenty
or fewer fragments are produced after restriction, then usually it is possible to
select an agarose concentration that results in each fragment being visible as
a separate band in the gel. If the starting DNA is long, and so gives rise to
many fragments after digestion with a restriction enzyme, then whatever
agarose concentration is used the gel may simply show a smear of DNA,
because there are fragments of every possible length that all merge together.
This is the usual result when genomic DNA is cut with a restriction enzyme.
If the sequence of the starting DNA is known, then the sequences, and hence
the sizes, of the fragments resulting from treatment with a particular restriction enzyme can be predicted. The band for a desired fragment (for example,
one containing a gene) can then be identified, cut out of the gel, and the DNA
purified. Even if its size is unknown, a fragment containing a gene or another
segment of DNA of interest can be identified by the technique called
Southern hybridization, providing that some of the sequence within the
fragment is known or can be predicted. The first step is to transfer the restriction fragments from the agarose gel to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane.
This is done by placing the membrane on the gel and allowing buffer to soak
through, taking the DNA from the gel to the membrane, where it becomes
bound (Figure 2.11A). This process results in the DNA bands becoming
immobilized in the same relative positions on the surface of the membrane.
The next step is to prepare a hybridization probe, which is a labeled DNA
molecule whose sequence is complementary to the target DNA that we wish
to detect. The probe could, for example, be a synthetic oligonucleotide whose
sequence matches part of an interesting gene. Because the probe and target
DNAs are complementary, they can base-pair or hybridize, the position of
the hybridized probe on the membrane being identified by detecting the signal given out by a label attached to the probe. To carry out the hybridization,
the membrane is placed in a glass bottle with the labeled probe and some
buffer, and the bottle gently rotated for several hours so that the probe has

plenty of opportunity to hybridize to its target DNA. The membrane is then
washed to remove any probe that has not become hybridized, and the signal
from the label is detected (see Technical Note 2.1). In the example shown in
Figure 2.11B the probe is radioactively labeled and the signal is detected by
autoradiography. The band that is seen on the autoradiograph is the one that
corresponds to the restriction fragment that hybridizes to the probe and
which therefore contains the gene that we are searching for.

with DNA ligase. (A) In living cells, DNA
ligase synthesizes a missing phosphodiester
bond in one strand of a double-stranded
DNA molecule. (B) To link two DNA
molecules in vitro, DNA ligase must make
two phosphodiester bonds, one in each
strand. (C) Ligation in vitro is more efficient
when the molecules have compatible sticky
ends, because transient base-pairing
between these ends holds the molecules
together and so increases the opportunity
for DNA ligase to attach and synthesize the
new phosphodiester bonds. For the role of
DNA ligase during DNA replication in vivo,
see Figure 15.18.

DNA fragments that have been generated by treatment with a restriction
endonuclease can be joined back together again, or attached to a new partner, by a DNA ligase. The reaction requires energy, which is provided by
adding either ATP or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to the reaction mixture, depending on the type of ligase that is being used.
The most widely used DNA ligase is obtained from E. coli cells infected with
T4 bacteriophage. This enzyme is involved in replication of the phage DNA
and is encoded by the T4 genome. Its natural role is to synthesize phosphodiester bonds between unlinked nucleotides present in one polynucleotide of a
double-stranded molecule (Figure 2.12A). In order to join together two
restriction fragments, the ligase has to synthesize two phosphodiester bonds,
one in each strand (Figure 2.12B). This is by no means beyond the capabilities
of the enzyme, but the reaction can occur only if the ends to be joined come
close enough to one another by chance—the ligase is not able to catch hold
of them and bring them together. If the two molecules have complementary
sticky ends, and the ends come together by random diffusion events in the
ligation mixture, then transient base pairs might form between the two overhangs. These base pairs are not particularly stable but they may persist for
sufficient time for a ligase enzyme to attach to the junction and synthesize
phosphodiester bonds to fuse the ends together (Figure 2.12C). If the molecules are blunt ended, then they cannot base-pair to one another, not even
temporarily, and ligation is a much less efficient process, even when the DNA
concentration is high and pairs of ends are in relatively close proximity.
The greater efficiency of sticky-end ligation has stimulated the development
of methods for converting blunt ends into sticky ends. In one method, short
double-stranded molecules called linkers or adaptors are attached to the
blunt ends. Linkers and adaptors work in slightly different ways, but both
contain a recognition sequence for a restriction endonuclease and so produce a sticky end after treatment with the appropriate enzyme (Figure 2.13).
Another way to create a sticky end is by homopolymer tailing, in which
nucleotides are added one after the other to the 3¢ terminus at a blunt end
(Figure 2.14). The enzyme involved is called terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase, which we will meet in the next section. If the reaction mixture
contains the DNA, enzyme, and only one of the four nucleotides, then the
new stretch of single-stranded DNA that is made consists entirely of just that
single nucleotide. It could, for example, be a poly(G) tail, which would enable
the molecule to base-pair to other molecules that carry poly(C) tails, created
in the same way but with dCTP, rather than dGTP, in the reaction mixture.

2.1.4 End-modification enzymes
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (see Figure 2.14), obtained from calf
thymus tissue, is one example of an end-modification enzyme. It is, in fact, a

Figure 2.13 Linkers are used to place
sticky ends on to a blunt-ended
molecule. In this example, each linker
contains the recognition sequence for the
restriction endonuclease BamHI. DNA ligase
attaches the linkers to the ends of the
blunt-ended molecule in a reaction that is
made relatively efficient because the linkers
are present at a high concentration. The
restriction enzyme is then added to cleave
the linkers and produce the sticky ends.
Note that during the ligation the linkers
ligate to one another, so a series of linkers
(a concatamer) is attached to each end of
the blunt molecule. When the restriction
enzyme is added, these linker concatamers
are cut into segments, with half of the
innermost linker left attached to the DNA
molecule. Adaptors are similar to linkers but
each one has one blunt end and one sticky
end. The blunt-ended DNA is therefore
given sticky ends simply by ligating it to the
adaptors: there is no need to carry out the
restriction step.

template-independent DNA polymerase, because it is able to synthesize a
new DNA polynucleotide without base-pairing of the incoming nucleotides
to an existing strand of DNA or RNA. Its main role in recombinant DNA technology is in homopolymer tailing, as described above.
Two other end-modification enzymes are also frequently used. These are
alkaline phosphatase and T4 polynucleotide kinase, which act in complementary ways. Alkaline phosphatase, which is obtained from various sources,
including E. coli and calf intestinal tissue, removes phosphate groups from
the 5¢ ends of DNA molecules, which prevents these molecules from being ligated to one another. Two ends carrying 5¢ phosphates can be ligated to one
another, and a phosphatased end can ligate to a nonphosphatased end, but a
link cannot be formed between a pair of ends if neither carries a 5¢ phosphate.
Judicious use of alkaline phosphatase can therefore direct the action of a DNA
ligase in a predetermined way so that only desired ligation products are
obtained. T4 polynucleotide kinase, obtained from E. coli cells infected with
T4 bacteriophage, performs the reverse reaction to alkaline phosphatase,
adding phosphates to 5¢ ends. Like alkaline phosphatase, the enzyme is used
during complicated ligation experiments, but its main application is in the
end-labeling of DNA molecules (see Technical Note 2.1).

2.2 DNA Cloning
DNA cloning is a logical extension of the ability to manipulate DNA molecules with restriction endonucleases and ligases. Imagine that an animal
gene has been obtained as a single restriction fragment after digestion of a
larger molecule with the restriction enzyme BamHI, which leaves 5¢–GATC–3¢
sticky ends (Figure 2.15). Imagine also that a plasmid—a small circle of DNA
capable of replicating inside a bacterium—has been purified from E. coli and
treated with BamHI, which cuts the plasmid in a single position. The circular

plasmid has therefore been converted into a linear molecule, again with
5¢–GATC–3¢ sticky ends. Mix the two DNA molecules together and add DNA
ligase. Various recombinant ligation products will be obtained, one of which
comprises the circularized plasmid with the animal gene inserted into the
position originally taken by the BamHI restriction site. If the recombinant
plasmid is now reintroduced into E. coli, and the inserted gene has not disrupted its replicative ability, then the plasmid plus inserted gene will be replicated and copies passed to the daughter bacteria after cell division. More
rounds of plasmid replication and cell division will result in a colony of
recombinant E. coli bacteria, each bacterium containing multiple copies of
the animal gene. This series of events, as illustrated in Figure 2.15, constitutes
the process called DNA or gene cloning.
When DNA cloning was first invented in the early 1970s, it revolutionized
molecular biology by making possible experiments that previously had been
inconceivable. This is because cloning can provide a pure sample of an individual gene, separated from all the other genes in the cell. Consider the basic
procedure drawn in a slightly different way (Figure 2.16). In this example, the
DNA fragment to be cloned is one member of a mixture of many different
fragments, each carrying a different gene or part of a gene. This mixture
could indeed be an entire genome. Each of these fragments becomes
inserted into a different plasmid molecule to produce a family of recombinant plasmids, one of which carries the gene of interest. Usually only one
recombinant molecule is transported into any single host cell, so that
although the final set of clones may contain many different recombinant
molecules, each individual clone contains multiple copies of just one. The
gene is now separated away from all the other genes in the original mixture.
Purification of the recombinant molecule from the bacterial colony, or from
a liquid culture grown from the colony, will yield microgram amounts of
DNA, sufficient for analysis by DNA sequencing or by one of the myriad
other techniques devised for the study of cloned genes, many of which we
will encounter in later chapters.

2.2.1 Cloning vectors and the way they are used

Many copies of the recombinant plasmid

Figure 2.15 An outline of gene cloning.

In the experiments shown in Figures 2.15 and 2.16, the plasmid acts as a
cloning vector, providing the replicative ability that enables the cloned gene
to be propagated inside the host cell. Plasmids replicate efficiently in bacterial hosts because each plasmid possesses an origin of replication that is recognized by the DNA polymerases and other proteins that normally replicate
the bacterium’s chromosomes (Section 15.2.1). The host cell’s replicative
machinery therefore propagates the plasmid, plus any new genes that have
been inserted into it. Bacteriophage genomes can also be used as cloning vectors because they too possess origins of replication that enable them to be
propagated inside bacteria, either by the host enzymes or by DNA polymerases and other proteins specified by phage genes. The next two sections
describe how plasmid and phage vectors are used to clone DNA in E. coli.
Plasmids are uncommon in eukaryotes, although Saccharomyces cerevisiae
possesses one that is sometimes used for cloning purposes; most vectors for
use in eukaryotic cells are therefore based on virus genomes. Alternatively,
with a eukaryotic host, the replication requirement can be bypassed by performing the experiment in such a way that the DNA to be cloned becomes
inserted into one of the host chromosomes. These approaches to cloning in
eukaryotic cells are described later in the chapter.

Vectors based on E. coli plasmids
The easiest way to understand how a cloning vector is used is to start with the
simplest E. coli plasmid vectors, which illustrate all of the basic principles of
DNA cloning. We will then be able to turn our attention to the special features
of phage vectors and vectors used with eukaryotes.

Plasmids

DNA fragments

Construct recombinant DNA molecules

One of the most popular plasmid vectors is pUC8, a member of a series of vectors that was first introduced in the early 1980s. The pUC series is derived from
an earlier cloning vector, pBR322, which was originally constructed by ligating
together restriction fragments from three naturally occurring E. coli plasmids:
R1, R6.5, and pMB1. pUC8 is a small plasmid, comprising just 2.7 kilobases
(kb). As well as its origin of replication, it carries two genes (Figure 2.17):
●

●

Each carries a different fragment

A gene for ampicillin resistance. The presence of this gene means that a
bacterium containing a pUC8 plasmid is able to synthesize an enzyme,
called b-lactamase, that enables the cell to withstand the growthinhibitory effect of the antibiotic. This means that cells containing pUC8
plasmids can be distinguished from those that do not by plating the bacteria onto agar medium containing ampicillin. Normal E. coli cells are sensitive to ampicillin and cannot grow when the antibiotic is present.
Ampicillin resistance is therefore a selectable marker for pUC8.

Transformation

Plate out

The lacZ¢ gene, which codes for part of the enzyme b-galactosidase.
b-galactosidase is one of a series of enzymes involved in the breakdown of
lactose to glucose plus galactose. It is normally coded by the gene lacZ,
which resides on the E. coli chromosome. Some strains of E. coli have a
modified lacZ gene, one that lacks the segment referred to as lacZ¢ and
coding for the a-peptide portion of b-galactosidase. These mutants can
synthesize the enzyme only when they harbor a plasmid, such as pUC8,
that carries the missing lacZ¢ segment of the gene.

To carry out a cloning experiment with pUC8, the manipulations shown in
Figure 2.15, resulting in construction of a recombinant plasmid, are performed in the test tube with purified DNA. Pure pUC8 DNA can be obtained
quite easily from extracts of bacterial cells (Technical Note 2.3), and after
manipulation the plasmids can be reintroduced into E. coli by transformation, the process by which “naked” DNA is taken up by a bacterial cell. This is
the system studied by Avery and his colleagues in the experiments that
showed that bacterial genes are made of DNA (Section 1.1.1). Transformation
is not a particularly efficient process in many bacteria, including E. coli, but
the rate of uptake can be enhanced significantly by suspending the cells in
calcium chloride before adding the DNA, and then briefly incubating the
mixture at 42˚C. Even after this enhancement, only a very small proportion of
the cells take up a plasmid. This is why the ampicillin-resistance marker is so
important—it allows the small number of transformants to be selected from
the large background of nontransformed cells.
The map of pUC8 shown in Figure 2.17 indicates that the lacZ¢ gene contains
a cluster of unique restriction sites. Ligation of new DNA into any one of these
sites results in insertional inactivation of the gene and hence loss of b-galactosidase activity. This is the key to distinguishing a recombinant plasmid—
one that contains an inserted piece of DNA—from a nonrecombinant plasmid
that has no new DNA. Identifying recombinants is important because the
manipulations illustrated in Figures 2.15 and 2.16 result in a variety of ligation
products, including plasmids that have recircularized without insertion of

Chapter 2 Studying DNA

Technical Note 2.3 DNA purification
Techniques for the preparation of pure samples of DNA from living cells play a central role in molecular
biology research
The first step in DNA purification is to break open the cells
from which the DNA will be obtained. With some types of
material this step is easy: cultured animal cells, for example, are broken open simply by adding a detergent such as
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), which disrupts the cell
membranes, releasing the cell contents. Other types of cell
have strong walls and so demand a harsher treatment.
Plant cells are usually frozen and then ground using a mortar and pestle, this being the only effective way of breaking
their cellulose walls. Bacteria such as Escherichia coli can
be lysed by a combination of enzymatic and chemical
treatment. The enzyme used is lysozyme, obtained from
egg white, which breaks down the polymeric compounds
in the bacterial cell wall, and the chemical is ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA), which chelates magnesium
ions, further reducing the integrity of the cell wall.
Disruption of the cell membrane, by adding a detergent,
then causes the cells to burst.
Once the cells have been broken, two different approaches
can be used to purify the DNA from the resulting extract.
The first involves degrading or removing all the cellular
components other than the DNA, a method that works best
if the cells do not contain large amounts of lipid or carbohydrate. The extract is first centrifuged at low speed to
remove debris such as pieces of cell wall, which form a pellet at the bottom of the tube (Figure T2.3). The supernatant
is transferred to another test tube and mixed with phenol,
which causes the protein to precipitate at the interface
between the organic and aqueous layers. The aqueous
layer, which contains the dissolved nucleic acids, is collected and a ribonuclease enzyme added, which breaks the
RNA into a mixture of nucleotides and short oligonucleotides. The DNA polynucleotides, which remain intact,

Cell extract

DNA, RNA, protein

In the second approach to DNA purification, rather than
degrading everything other than DNA, the DNA itself is
selectively removed from the extract. One way of doing this
is by ion-exchange chromatography, which separates
molecules according to how tightly they bind to electrically
charged particles in a chromatography resin. DNA and RNA
are both negatively charged, as are some proteins, and so
bind to a positively charged resin. The simplest way to carry
out ion-exchange chromatography is to place the resin in a
column and add the cell extract to the top (Figure T2.4).
The extract passes through the column, and all the negatively charged molecules bind to the resin. The binding,
which involves ionic interactions, can be disrupted by
adding a salt solution, with the less tightly bound molecules detaching from the resin at relatively low salt concentrations. This means that if a solution of gradually increasing salt concentration is passed through the column, then
different types of molecule elute in the sequence protein,
RNA and DNA, reflecting their relative binding strengths. In
fact, such careful separation is usually not needed so just
two salt solutions are used, one containing 1.0 M NaCl at
pH 7.0, sufficient to elute the protein and RNA, leaving just
the DNA bound, followed by a second solution containing
1.25 M NaCl at pH 8.5, which elutes the DNA, now free
from protein and RNA contaminants.

DNA Cloning

The two approaches described above purify all the DNA in
a cell. Special methods are needed if the aim is to obtain
just plasmid DNA (for example, recombinant cloning vectors) from bacterial cells. One popular method makes use
of the fact that, although both plasmids and the bacterial
chromosome are made up of supercoiled DNA, lysis of the
bacterial cell inevitably leads to a certain amount of disruption of the bacterial chromosome, leading to loss of supercoiling. A cell extract therefore contains supercoiled plasmid
DNA and nonsupercoiled chromosomal DNA, and the plasmids can be purified by a method that distinguishes
between DNA molecules with these different conformations. One technique involves adding sodium hydroxide
until the pH of the cell extract reaches 12.0–12.5, which
causes the base pairs in nonsupercoiled DNA to break. The
resulting single strands tangle up into an insoluble network
that can be removed by centrifugation, leaving the supercoiled plasmids in the supernatant.

new DNA. Screening for b-galactosidase presence or absence is, in fact, quite
easy. Rather than assay for lactose being split to glucose and galactose, the
presence of functional b-galactosidase molecules in the cells is checked by a
histochemical test with a compound called X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3indolyl-b-D-galactopyranoside), which the enzyme converts into a blue product. If X-gal (plus an inducer of the enzyme such as isopropylthiogalactoside,
IPTG) is added to the agar, along with ampicillin, then nonrecombinant
colonies, the cells of which synthesize b-galactosidase, will be colored blue,
whereas recombinants with a disrupted lacZ¢ gene, which are unable to make
b-galactosidase, will be white (Figure 2.18). This system is called Lac selection.

Chapter 2 Studying DNA

Cloning vectors based on E. coli bacteriophage genomes
E. coli bacteriophages were developed as cloning vectors back in the earliest
days of the recombinant DNA revolution. The main reason for seeking a different type of vector was the inability of plasmids such as pUC8 to handle
DNA fragments greater than about 10 kb in size, larger inserts undergoing
rearrangements or interfering with the plasmid replication system in such a
way that the recombinant DNA molecules become lost from the host cells.
The first attempts to develop vectors able to handle larger fragments of DNA
centered on bacteriophage l.
To replicate, a bacteriophage must enter a bacterial cell and subvert the bacterial enzymes into expressing the information contained in the phage genes,
so that the bacterium synthesizes new phages. Once replication is complete,

the new phages leave the bacterium, usually causing its death as they do so,
and move on to infect new cells (Figure 2.19A). This is called a lytic infection
cycle, because it results in lysis of the bacterium. As well as the lytic cycle, l
(unlike many other types of bacteriophage) can also follow a lysogenic infection cycle, during which the l genome integrates into the bacterial chromosome, where it can remain quiescent for many generations, being replicated
along with the host chromosome every time the cell divides (Figure 2.19B).
The size of the l genome is 48.5 kb, of which some 15 kb or so is “optional” in
that it contains genes that are only needed for integration of the phage DNA
into the E. coli chromosome (Figure 2.20A). These segments can therefore be
deleted without impairing the ability of the phage to infect bacteria and
direct synthesis of new l particles by the lytic cycle. Two types of vector have
been developed (Figure 2.20B):
G

Insertion vectors, in which part or all of the optional DNA has been
removed, and a unique restriction site introduced at some position within
the trimmed-down genome.

G

Replacement vectors, in which the optional DNA is contained within a
stuffer fragment, flanked by a pair of restriction sites, that is replaced
when the DNA to be cloned is ligated into the vector.

The l genome is linear, but the two natural ends of the molecule have 12nucleotide single-stranded overhangs, called cos sites, which have complementary sequences and so can base-pair to one another. A l cloning vector
can therefore be obtained as a circular molecule that can be manipulated in
the test tube in the same way as a plasmid, and reintroduced into E. coli by
transfection, the term used for uptake of naked phage DNA. Alternatively, a
more efficient uptake system called in vitro packaging can be utilized. This
procedure starts with the linear version of the cloning vector, the initial
restriction cutting the molecule into two segments, the left and right arms,
each with a cos site at one end. The ligation is carried out with carefully
measured quantities of each arm and the DNA to be cloned, the aim being to

with the appropriate restriction
endonuclease produces the left and right

between the two arms during the ligation
step. These arms also ligate to one another
via their cos sites, forming a concatamer.
Some parts of the concatamer comprise left
arm–insert DNA–right arm and, assuming
this combination is 37–52 kb in length, will
be enclosed inside the capsid by the in vitro
packaging mix. Parts of the concatamer
made up of left arm ligated directly to right
arm, without new DNA, are too short to be

produce concatamers in which the different fragments are linked together in
the order left arm–new DNA–right arm, as shown in Figure 2.21. The concatamers are then added to an in vitro packaging mix, which contains all the
proteins needed to make a l phage particle. These proteins form phage particles spontaneously, and will place inside the particles any DNA fragment
that is between 37 kb and 52 kb in length and is flanked by cos sites. The
packaging mix therefore cuts left arm–new DNA–right arm combinations of
37–52 kb out of the concatamers and constructs l phages around them. The
phages are then mixed with E. coli cells, and the natural infection process
transports the vector plus new DNA into the bacteria.

Infection visualized as a plaque,
a zone of clearing in a lawn of bacteria

Figure 2.22 Bacteriophage infection is
visualized as a plaque on a lawn of
bacteria.

After infection, the cells are spread onto an agar plate. The objective is not to
obtain individual colonies but to produce an even layer of bacteria across the
entire surface of the agar. Bacteria that were infected with the packaged
cloning vector die within about 20 minutes because the l genes contained in
the arms of the vector direct replication of the DNA and synthesis of new
phages by the lytic cycle, each of these new phages containing its own copy of
the vector plus cloned DNA. Death and lysis of the bacterium releases these
phages into the surrounding medium, where they infect new cells and begin
another round of phage replication and lysis. The end result is a zone of clearing, called a plaque, which is visible on the lawn of bacteria that grows on the
agar plate (Figure 2.22). With some l vectors, all plaques are made up of
recombinant phages because ligation of the two arms without insertion of
new DNA results in a molecule that is too short to be packaged. With other vectors it is necessary to distinguish recombinant plaques from nonrecombinant
ones. Various methods are used, including the b-galactosidase system

described above for the plasmid vector pUC8 (see Figure 2.18), which is also
applicable to those l vectors that carry a fragment of the lacZ gene into which
the DNA to be cloned is inserted.

Vectors for longer pieces of DNA
The l phage particle can accommodate up to 52 kb of DNA, so if the genome
has 15 kb removed, then up to 18 kb of new DNA can be cloned. This limit is
higher than that for plasmid vectors, but is still very small compared with the
sizes of intact genomes. The comparison is important because a clone
library—a collection of clones whose inserts cover an entire genome—is
often the starting point for a project aimed at determining the sequence of
that genome (Chapter 4). If a l vector is used with human DNA, then over half
a million clones are needed for there to be a 95% chance of any particular part
of the genome being present in the library (Table 2.4). It is possible to prepare
a library comprising half a million clones, especially if automated techniques
are used, but such a large collection is far from ideal. It would be much better
to reduce the number of clones by using a vector that is able to handle fragments of DNA longer than 18 kb. Many of the developments in cloning technology over the last 20 years have been aimed at finding ways of doing this.
One possibility is to use a cosmid—a plasmid that carries a l cos site (Figure
2.23). Concatamers of cosmid molecules, linked at their cos sites, act as substrates for in vitro packaging because the cos site is the only sequence that a
DNA molecule needs in order to be recognized as a “l genome” by the proteins that package DNA into l phage particles. Particles containing cosmid
DNA are as infective as real l phages, but once inside the cell the cosmid cannot direct synthesis of new phage particles and instead replicates as a plasmid. Recombinant DNA is therefore obtained from colonies rather than
plaques. As with other types of l vector, the upper limit for the length of the
cloned DNA is set by the space available within the l phage particle. A cosmid
can be 8 kb or less in size, so up to 44 kb of new DNA can be inserted before
the packaging limit of the l phage particle is reached. This reduces the size of

DNA containing the cos site, and an

The first major breakthrough in attempts to clone DNA fragments much
longer than 50 kb came with the invention of yeast artificial chromosomes,
or YACs. These vectors are propagated in S. cerevisiae, rather than in E. coli,
and are based on chromosomes, rather than on plasmids or viruses. The first
YACs were constructed after studies of natural chromosomes had shown that,
in addition to the genes that it carries, each chromosome has three important
components (Figure 2.24):
G

The centromere, which plays a critical role during nuclear division.

G

The telomeres, the special sequences that mark the ends of chromosomal
DNA molecules.

G

One or more origins of replication, which initiate synthesis of new DNA
when the chromosome divides.

In a YAC, the DNA sequences that underlie these chromosomal components
are linked together with one or more selectable markers and at least one
restriction site into which new DNA can be inserted (Figure 2.25). All of these
components can be contained in a DNA molecule of size 10–15 kb. Natural
yeast chromosomes range in size from 230 kb to over 1700 kb, so YACs have the
potential to clone megabase (Mb)-sized DNA fragments. This potential has
been realized, standard YACs being able to clone 600 kb fragments, with special types able to handle DNA up to 1400 kb in length. This is the highest capacity of any type of cloning vector, and several of the early genome projects made
extensive use of YACs. Unfortunately, with some types of YAC there have been
problems with insert stability, the cloned DNA becoming rearranged into new
sequence combinations. For this reason there is also great interest in other
types of vectors, ones that cannot clone such large pieces of DNA but which
suffer less from instability problems. These vectors include the following:
G

Bacterial artificial chromosomes, or BACs, are based on the naturally
occurring F plasmid of E. coli. Unlike the plasmids used to construct the
early cloning vectors, the F plasmid is relatively large and vectors based on
it have a higher capacity for accepting inserted DNA. BACs are designed so
that recombinants can be identified by Lac selection (see Figure 2.18) and
hence are easy to use. They can clone fragments of 300 kb and longer, and
the inserts are very stable. BACs were used extensively in the Human
Genome Project (Section 4.3) and they are currently the most popular vectors for cloning large pieces of DNA.

G

Bacteriophage P1 vectors are very similar to l vectors, being based on a
deleted version of a natural phage genome, the capacity of the cloning
vector being determined by the size of the deletion and the space within
the phage particle. The P1 genome is larger than the l genome, and the
phage particle is bigger, so a P1 vector can clone larger fragments of DNA
than a l vector, up to 125 kb using current technology.

G

P1-derived artificial chromosomes, or PACs, combine features of P1 vectors and BACs, and have a capacity of up to 300 kb.

G

Fosmids contain the F plasmid origin of replication and a l cos site. They
are similar to cosmids but have a lower copy number in E. coli, which
means that they are less prone to instability problems.

the circular vector is digested with BamHI and SnaBI. BamHI restriction removes the stuffer
fragment held between the two telomeres in the circular molecule. SnaBI cuts within the
SUP4 gene and provides the site into which new DNA will be inserted. Ligation of the two
vector arms with new DNA produces the structure shown at the bottom. This structure carries
functional copies of the TRP1 and URA3 selectable markers. The host strain has inactivated
copies of these genes, which means that it requires tryptophan and uracil as nutrients. After
transformation, cells are plated onto a minimal medium lacking tryptophan and uracil. Only
cells that contain the vector, and so can synthesize tryptophan and uracil, are able to survive
on this medium and produce colonies. Note that if a vector comprises two right arms, or two
left arms, then it will not give rise to colonies because the transformed cells will still require
one of the nutrients. The presence of insert DNA in the cloned vector molecules is checked
by testing for inactivation of SUP4. This is done by a color test: on the appropriate medium,
colonies containing recombinant vectors (i.e., with an insert) are white; nonrecombinants
(vector but no insert) are red.

engineering experiments aimed at modifying the biological characteristics of
the host organism, and of synthesizing important animal proteins, such as
pharmaceuticals, in a new host cell from which the proteins can be obtained
in larger quantities than is possible by conventional purification from
animal tissue. These multifarious applications demand that genes must frequently be cloned in organisms other than E. coli.

Figure 2.26 Cloning with a YIp. (A) YIp5,
a typical yeast integrative plasmid. The
plasmid contains the ampicillin-resistance
gene (ampR), the tetracycline-resistance
gene (tetR), the yeast gene URA3, and an
Escherichia coli origin of replication (ori).
The presence of the E. coli ori means that
recombinant YIp5 molecules can be
constructed in E. coli before their transfer
into yeast cells. YIp5 is therefore a shuttle
vector—it can be shuttled between two
species. (B) YIp5 has no origin of replication
that can function inside yeast cells, but can
survive if it integrates into the yeast
chromosomal DNA by homologous
recombination between the plasmid and
chromosomal copies of the URA3 gene.
The chromosomal gene carries a small
mutation that means that it is nonfunctional
and the host cells are ura3–. One of the
pair of URA3 genes that is formed after
integration of the plasmid DNA is mutated,
but the other is not. Recombinant cells are
therefore ura3+ and can be selected by
plating onto minimal medium, which does
not contain uracil.

(A) Ylp5

Cloning vectors based on plasmids or phages have been developed for most
of the well-studied species of bacteria, such as Bacillus, Streptomyces, and
Pseudomonas, these vectors being used in exactly the same way as the E. coli
analogs. Plasmid vectors are also available for yeasts and fungi. Some of
these carry the origin of replication from the 2 mm circle, a plasmid present
in many strains of S. cerevisiae, but other plasmid vectors only have an E.
coli origin. An example is YIp5, an S. cerevisiae vector that is simply an E.coli
plasmid that contains a copy of the yeast gene called URA3 (Figure 2.26A).
The presence of the E. coli origin means that YIp5 is a shuttle vector that
can be used with either E. coli or S. cerevisiae as the host. This is a useful feature because cloning in S. cerevisiae is a relatively inefficient process, and
generating a large number of clones is difficult. If the experiment requires
that the desired recombinant be identified from a mixture of clones (as
illustrated in Figure 2.16), then it may not be possible to obtain enough
recombinants to find the correct one. To avoid this problem, construction of
recombinant DNA molecules and selection of the correct recombinant is
carried out with E. coli as the host. When the correct clones have been identified, the recombinant YIp5 molecules are purified and transferred into S.
cerevisiae, usually by mixing the DNA with protoplasts—yeast cells whose
walls have been removed by enzyme treatment. Without an origin of replication, the vector is unable to propagate independently inside yeast cells,
but it can survive if it becomes integrated into one of the yeast chromosomes, which can occur by homologous recombination (Section 5.2.2)
between the URA3 gene carried by the vector and the chromosomal copy of
this gene (Figure 2.26B). “YIp” in fact stands for “yeast integrative plasmid”.
Once integrated, the YIp, plus any DNA that has been inserted into it, replicates along with the host chromosomes.
Integration into chromosomal DNA is also a feature of many of the cloning
systems used with animals and plants, and forms the basis of the construction

of knockout mice, which are used to determine the functions of previously
unknown genes that are discovered in the human genome (Section 5.2.2). The
vectors are animal equivalents of YIps. Adenoviruses and retroviruses are used
to clone genes in animals when the objective is to treat a genetic disease or a
cancer by gene therapy. A similar range of vectors has been developed for
cloning genes in plants. Plasmids can be introduced into plant embryos by
bombardment with DNA-coated microprojectiles, a process called biolistics.
Integration of the plasmid DNA into the plant chromosomes, followed by
growth of the embryo, then results in a plant that contains the cloned DNA in
most or all of its cells. Some success has also been achieved with plant vectors
based on the genomes of caulimoviruses and geminiviruses, but the most
interesting types of plant cloning vector are those derived from the Ti plasmid, a large bacterial plasmid found in the soil microorganism Agrobacterium
tumefaciens. Part of the Ti plasmid, the region called the T-DNA, becomes
integrated into a plant chromosome when the bacterium infects a plant stem
and causes crown gall disease. The T-DNA carries a number of genes that are
expressed inside the plant cells and induce the various physiological changes
that characterize the disease. Vectors such as pBIN19 (Figure 2.27) have been
designed to make use of this natural genetic engineering system. The recombinant vector is introduced into A. tumefaciens cells, which are allowed to
infect a cell suspension or plant callus culture, from which mature, transformed plants can be regenerated.

2.3 The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
DNA cloning is a powerful technique and its impact on our understanding of
genes and genomes has been immeasurable. Cloning does, however, have
one major disadvantage: it is a time-consuming and, in parts, difficult procedure. It takes several days to perform the manipulations needed to insert
DNA fragments into a cloning vector and then introduce the ligated molecules into the host cells and select recombinants. If the experimental strategy
involves generation of a large clone library, followed by screening of the
library to identify a clone that contains a gene of interest (see Technical Note
2.4), then several more weeks, or even months, might be needed to complete
the project.
PCR complements DNA cloning in that it enables the same result to be
achieved—purification of a specified DNA fragment—but in a much shorter
time, perhaps just a few hours. PCR is complementary to, not a replacement
for, cloning because it has its own limitations, the most important of which is
the need to know the sequence of at least part of the fragment that is to be
purified. Despite this constraint, PCR has acquired central importance in
many areas of molecular biology research. We will examine the technique
first, and then survey its applications.

2.3.1 Carrying out a PCR
PCR results in the repeated copying of a selected region of a DNA molecule
(see Figure 2.3). Unlike cloning, PCR is a test-tube reaction and does not
involve the use of living cells: the copying is carried out not by cellular
enzymes but by the purified, thermostable DNA polymerase of T. aquaticus
(Section 2.1.1). The reason why a thermostable enzyme is needed will become
clear when we look in more detail at the events that occur during PCR.

sequences from the T-DNA region of the Ti
plasmid. These two boundary sequences
recombine with plant chromosomal DNA,
inserting the segment of DNA between
them into the plant DNA. The orientation of
the boundary sequences in pBIN19 means
that the lacZ¢ and kanR genes, as well as
any new DNA ligated into the restriction
sites within lacZ¢, are transferred to the
plant DNA. Recombinant plant cells are
selected by plating onto kanamycin agar,
and then regenerated into whole plants.

shuttle vector, recombinant molecules being
constructed in E. coli, using the lacZ¢
selection system, before transfer to
Agrobacterium tumefaciens and thence to

Chapter 2 Studying DNA

Technical Note 2.4 Working with a clone library
Clone collections are used as a source of genes and other DNA segments
Since the 1970s, clone libraries have been prepared from
different organisms as a means of obtaining individual
genes, and other DNA segments, for further study by
sequencing and other recombinant DNA techniques.
Libraries can be prepared from either genomic DNA or
cDNA, using a plasmid or bacteriophage vector. The clones
are usually stored as bacterial colonies or plaques on 23 ¥
23 cm agar plates, with 100,000–150,000 clones per
plate. A complete human library can therefore be contained
in just 1–8 plates, depending on the type of cloning vector
that has been used (see Table 2.4). Three methods can
identify the clone that contains the gene or other piece of
DNA that is being sought:
Hybridization analysis can be performed with a labeled
oligonucleotide or other DNA molecule that is known to
hybridize to the sequence of interest. To do this, a nylon or
nitrocellulose membrane is placed on the surface of the
agar dish and then carefully removed to “lift off” the
colonies or plaques. Treatment with alkali and protease
degrades the cellular material, leaving behind the DNA
from each clone, which is then bound tightly to the surface
of the membrane by heating or ultraviolet irradiation. The
labeled probe is now applied to the membrane, in the
same way as in Southern hybridization (Figure 2.11), and
the position at which the probe attaches determined by the
appropriate detection method. The position of the

hybridization signal on the membrane corresponds to the
location of the clone of interest on the agar plate.
PCR (Section 2.3) can be used to screen clones for the
sequence of interest. This cannot be done in situ, so individual clones must be transferred to the wells of microtiter
trays. The PCR approach to clone identification is therefore
relatively cumbersome because only a few hundred clones
can be accommodated in a single tray. PCRs using primers
specific for the sequence of interest are performed with
each clone in turn, possibly using a combinatorial
approach to reduce the number of PCRs that are needed
in order to identify the one that gives a positive result (see
Figure 4.14).
Immunological techniques can be used if the sequence
being sought is a gene that is expressed in the cell in which
the clone library has been prepared. If gene expression is
occurring then the protein product will be made, and this
can be detected by screening the library with a labeled antibody that binds only to that protein. As in hybridization
analysis, the clones are first transferred onto a membrane,
and then treated to break down the cells and bind the protein to the membrane surface. Exposure of the membrane
to the labeled antibody then reveals the position of the
clone containing the gene of interest.

To carry out a PCR experiment, the target DNA is mixed with Taq DNA polymerase, a pair of oligonucleotide primers, and a supply of nucleotides. The
amount of target DNA can be very small because PCR is extremely sensitive
and will work with just a single starting molecule. The primers are needed to
initiate the DNA synthesis reactions that will be carried out by the Taq polymerase (see Figure 2.6). They must attach to the target DNA at either side of
the segment that is to be copied: the sequences of these attachment sites
must therefore be known so that primers of the appropriate sequences can be
synthesized.
The reaction is started by heating the mixture to 94˚C. At this temperature the
hydrogen bonds that hold together the two polynucleotides of the double
helix are broken, so the target DNA becomes denatured into single-stranded
molecules (Figure 2.28). The temperature is then reduced to 50˚C–60˚C,
which results in some rejoining of the single strands of the target DNA, but
also allows the primers to attach to their annealing positions. DNA synthesis

The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

can now begin, so the temperature is raised to 72˚C, the optimum for Taq
polymerase. In this first stage of the PCR, a set of “long” products is synthesized from each strand of the target DNA. These polynucleotides have identical 5¢ ends but random 3¢ ends, the latter representing positions where DNA
synthesis terminates by chance. When the cycle of denaturation–
annealing–synthesis is repeated, the long products act as templates for new
DNA synthesis, giving rise to “short” products, the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of which are
both set by the primer annealing positions (Figure 2.29). In subsequent
cycles, the number of short products accumulates in an exponential fashion
(doubling during each cycle) until one of the components of the reaction
becomes depleted. This means that after 30 cycles, there will be over 250 million short products derived from each starting molecule. In real terms, this
equates to several micrograms of PCR product from a few nanograms or less
of target DNA.

The results of a PCR can be determined in various ways. Usually, the products
are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, which will reveal a single band if
the PCR has worked as expected and has amplified a single segment of the
target DNA (Figure 2.30). Alternatively, the sequence of the product can be
determined, using techniques described in Section 4.1.1.

2.3.2 The applications of PCR
PCR is such a straightforward procedure that it is sometimes difficult to
understand how it can have become so important in modern research. First
we will deal with its limitations. In order to synthesize primers that will
anneal at the correct positions, the sequences of the boundary regions of the
DNA to be amplified must be known. This means that PCR cannot be used to
purify fragments of genes, or other parts of a genome, that have never been
studied before. A second constraint is the length of DNA that can be copied.
Regions of up to 5 kb can be amplified without too much difficulty, and
longer amplifications—up to 40 kb—are possible using modifications of the
standard technique. However, the fragments greater than 100 kb that are
needed for genome sequencing projects, and which can be obtained by
cloning in a BAC or other high-capacity vector, are unattainable by PCR.
What are the strengths of PCR? Primary among these is the ease with which
products representing a single segment of the genome can be obtained from
a number of different DNA samples. We will encounter one important example of this in the next chapter when we look at how DNA markers are typed in
genetic mapping projects (Section 3.2.2). PCR is used in a similar way to
screen human DNA samples for mutations associated with genetic diseases
such as thalassemia and cystic fibrosis. It also forms the basis of genetic profiling, in which variations in microsatellite length are typed (see Figure 7.24).
A second important feature of PCR is its ability to work with minuscule
amounts of starting DNA. This means that PCR can be used to obtain
sequences from the trace amounts of DNA that are present in hairs, bloodstains, and other forensic specimens, and from bones and other remains preserved at archaeological sites. In clinical diagnosis, PCR is able to detect the
presence of viral DNA well before the virus has reached the levels needed to
initiate a disease response. This is particularly important in the early identification of viral-induced cancers because it means that treatment programs
can be initiated before the cancer becomes established.

PCR has been carried out in a microfuge
tube. A sample is loaded into lane 2 of an
agarose gel. Lane 1 contains DNA size
markers, and lane 3 contains a sample of a
PCR carried out by a colleague. After
electrophoresis, the gel is stained with
ethidium bromide (see Technical Note 2.2).
Lane 2 contains a single band of the
expected size, showing that the PCR has
been successful. In lane 3 there is no
band—this PCR has not worked.

The above are just a few of the applications of PCR. The technique is now a
major component of the molecular biologist’s toolkit, and we will discover
many more examples of its use as we progress through the remaining chapters of this book.

Summary
Over the last 35 years, molecular biologists have built up a comprehensive
toolkit of techniques that can be used to study DNA. These techniques form
the basis of recombinant DNA technology and led to the development of
DNA cloning and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A central feature of
recombinant DNA technology is the use of purified enzymes to make specified changes to DNA molecules in the test tube. The four main types of
enzyme used in this way are DNA polymerases, nucleases, ligases, and endmodification enzymes. DNA polymerases synthesize new DNA polynucleotides, and are used in procedures such as DNA sequencing, PCR, and
DNA labeling. The most important nucleases are the restriction endonucleases, which cut double-stranded DNA molecules at specific nucleotide
sequences, and hence cut a molecule into a predicted set of fragments, the
sizes of which can be determined by agarose gel electrophoresis. Ligases join
molecules together, and end-modification enzymes carry out a variety of
reactions including several used to label DNA molecules. DNA cloning is a
means of obtaining a pure sample of an individual gene or other segment of
a DNA molecule. Many different types of cloning vector have been designed
for use with E. coli as the host organism, the simplest being based on small
plasmids that carry markers such as the lacZ¢ gene. This gene enables recombinant colonies to be identified because they appear white, rather than blue,
when X-gal is present in the growth medium. Bacteriophage l has also been
used as the basis for a series of E. coli cloning vectors, including the plasmid–phage hybrids called cosmids, which are used to clone fragments of
DNA up to 44 kb in length. Other types of vector, such as bacterial artificial
chromosomes, can be used to clone even longer pieces of DNA, up to 300 kb
in length. These high-capacity vectors are used in construction of clone
libraries, collections of clones whose inserts cover an entire genome and
which are used to provide material for a genome sequencing project.
Organisms other than E. coli can also be used as the hosts for DNA cloning.
Several types of vector have been designed for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and
specialized techniques are available for cloning DNA in animals and plants.
PCR provides a complement to DNA cloning by enabling specified segments
of DNA to be purified quickly, but at least part of the DNA sequence of this
fragment must be known. In PCR, a thermostable DNA polymerase makes
repeated copies of the target sequence and of the copies made in earlier
rounds of the reaction. Starting with just a single target molecule, over 250
million copies can be made during 30 cycles of a PCR.

When you have read Chapter 3, you should be able to:
Explain why a map is an important aid to genome sequencing.
Distinguish between the terms “genetic map” and “physical map.”
Describe the different types of marker used to construct genetic maps, and state how each type of
marker is scored.
Summarize the principles of inheritance as discovered by Mendel, and show how subsequent
genetic research led to the development of linkage analysis.
Explain how linkage analysis is used to construct genetic maps, giving details of how the analysis is
carried out in various types of organism, including humans and bacteria.
State the limitations of genetic mapping.
Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods used to construct physical maps
of genomes.
Describe how restriction mapping is carried out.
Describe how fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to construct a physical map, including
the modifications used to increase the sensitivity of this technique.
Explain the basis of sequence tagged site (STS) mapping, and list the various DNA sequences that
can be used as STSs.
Describe how radiation hybrids and clone libraries are used in STS mapping.

The next two chapters describe the techniques and strategies used to obtain
genome sequences. DNA sequencing is obviously paramount among these
techniques, but sequencing has one major limitation: even with the most
sophisticated technology it is rarely possible to obtain a sequence of more than
about 750 base pairs (bp) in a single experiment. This means that the sequence
of a long DNA molecule has to be constructed from a series of shorter
sequences. This is done by breaking the molecule into fragments, determining

Figure 3.1 The shotgun method for
sequence assembly. The DNA molecule is
broken into small fragments, each of which is
sequenced. The master sequence is
assembled by searching for overlaps between
the sequences of individual fragments. In
practice, an overlap of several tens of base
pairs would be needed to establish that two
sequences should be linked together.

the sequence of each one, and using a computer to search for overlaps and
build up the master sequence (Figure 3.1). This shotgun method is the standard approach for sequencing small prokaryotic genomes (Section 4.2.1), but is
much more difficult with larger genomes because the required data analysis
becomes disproportionately more complex as the number of fragments
increases (for n fragments, the number of possible overlaps is given by 2n2 – 2n).
A second problem with the shotgun method is that it can lead to errors when
repetitive regions of a genome are analyzed. When a repetitive sequence is broken into fragments, many of the resulting pieces contain the same, or very similar, sequence motifs. It would be very easy to reassemble these sequences so
that a portion of a repetitive region is left out, or even to connect together two
quite separate pieces of the same or different chromosomes (Figure 3.2).
The difficulties in applying the shotgun method to a large molecule that has
a significant repetitive DNA content means that this approach cannot be
used on its own to sequence a eukaryotic genome. Instead, a genome map
must first be generated. A genome map provides a guide for the sequencing
experiments by showing the positions of genes and other distinctive features.
Once a genome map is available, the sequencing phase of the project can
proceed in either of two ways (Figure 3.3):
G

By the whole-genome shotgun method (Section 4.2.3), which takes the
same approach as the standard shotgun procedure but uses the distinctive
features on the genome map as landmarks to aid assembly of the master
sequence from the huge numbers of short sequences that are obtained.
Reference to the map also ensures that regions containing repetitive DNA
are assembled correctly. The whole-genome shotgun method is a rapid
way of obtaining a draft of a eukaryotic genome sequence.

G

By the clone contig method (Section 4.2.2). In this method the genome
is broken into manageable segments, each a few hundred kilobases or a
few megabases in length, which are short enough to be sequenced accurately by the shotgun method. Once the sequence of a segment has been

Figure 3.2 Problems with the shotgun method. (A) The DNA molecule contains a tandemly repeated element made up of many copies of
the sequence GATTA. When the sequences are examined, an overlap is identified between two fragments, but these are from either end of the
tandem repeat. If the error is not recognized then the internal region of the tandem repeat will be omitted from the master sequence. (B) In
the second example, the DNA molecule contains two copies of a repeat element. When the sequences are examined, two fragments appear
to overlap, but one fragment contains the left-hand part of one repeat and the other fragment has the right-hand part of the second repeat. In
this case, failure to recognize the error would lead to the segment of DNA between the two repeats being left out of the master sequence. If
the two repeats were on different chromosomes, then the sequences of these chromosomes might mistakenly be linked together.

completed, it is positioned at its correct location on the map. This stepby-step approach takes longer than whole-genome shotgun sequencing,
but produces a more accurate and error-free sequence.
With both methods, the map provides the framework for carrying out the
sequencing phase of the project. If the map indicates the positions of genes,
then it can also be used to direct the initial part of a clone contig project to the
interesting regions of a genome, so that the sequences of important genes are
obtained as quickly as possible.

3.1 Genetic and Physical Maps
The convention is to divide genome mapping methods into two categories.
G

Genetic mapping is based on the use of genetic techniques to construct
maps showing the positions of genes and other sequence features on a
genome. Genetic techniques include cross-breeding experiments or, in
the case of humans, the examination of family histories (pedigrees).
Genetic mapping is described in Section 3.2.

G

Physical mapping uses molecular biology techniques to examine DNA molecules directly in order to construct maps showing the positions of sequence
features, including genes. Physical mapping is described in Section 3.3.

3.2 Genetic Mapping
As with any type of map, a genetic map must show the positions of distinctive
features. In a geographic map these markers are recognizable components of

Figure 3.3 Alternative approaches to
genome sequencing. A genome consisting
of a linear DNA molecule of size 2.5 Mb
has been mapped, and the positions of
eight markers (A–H) are known. On the left,
the clone contig method starts with a
segment of DNA whose position on the
genome map has been identified because it
contains markers A and B. The segment is
sequenced by the shotgun method and the
master sequence placed at its known
position on the map. On the right, the
whole-genome shotgun method involves
random sequencing of the entire genome.
This results in pieces of contiguous
sequence, possibly hundreds of kilobases in
length. If a contiguous sequence contains a
marker, then it can be positioned on the
genome map. Note that with either method,
the more markers there are on the genome
map the better. For more details of these
sequencing strategies, see Section 4.2.

the landscape, such as rivers, roads and buildings. What markers can we use
in a genetic landscape?

3.2.1 Genes were the first markers to be used
The first genetic maps, constructed in the early decades of the twentieth century for organisms such as the fruit fly, used genes as markers. To be useful in
genetic analysis, a gene must exist in at least two forms, or alleles, each specifying a different phenotype, an example being tall or short stems in the pea
plants originally studied by Gregor Mendel. To begin with, the only genes that
could be studied were those specifying phenotypes that were distinguishable
by visual examination. So, for example, the first fruit-fly maps showed the
positions of genes for body color, eye color, wing shape, and suchlike, all of
these phenotypes being visible simply by looking at the flies with a low-power
microscope or the naked eye. This approach was fine in the early days but
geneticists soon realized that there were only a limited number of visual phenotypes whose inheritance could be studied, and in many cases their analysis was complicated because a single phenotype could be affected by more
than one gene. For example, by 1922, over 50 genes had been mapped onto
the four fruit-fly chromosomes, but nine of these genes were for eye color. In
later research, geneticists studying fruit flies had to learn to distinguish
between fly eyes that were colored red, light red, vermilion, garnet, carnation,
cinnabar, ruby, sepia, scarlet, pink, cardinal, claret, purple, or brown. To make
gene maps more comprehensive, it was necessary to find characteristics that
were more distinctive and less complex than visual ones.
The answer was to use biochemistry to distinguish phenotypes. This has been
particularly important with two types of organisms—microbes and humans.
Microbes, such as bacteria and yeast, have very few visual characteristics, so
gene mapping with these organisms has to rely on biochemical phenotypes
such as those listed in Table 3.1. For humans it is possible to use visual characteristics but, since the 1920s, studies of human genetic variation have been
based largely on biochemical phenotypes that can be scored by blood typing.
These phenotypes include not only the standard blood groups, such as the
ABO series, but also variants of blood serum proteins and of immunological
proteins such as the human leukocyte antigens (the HLA system). A big advantage of these markers is that many of the relevant genes have multiple alleles.
For example, the gene called HLA-DRB1 has at least 290 alleles and HLA-B has

over 400. This is relevant because of the way in which gene mapping is carried
out with humans (Section 3.2.4). Rather than setting up planned breeding
experiments, which is the procedure with experimental organisms such as
fruit flies or mice, data on inheritance of human genes have to be gleaned by
examining the phenotypes displayed by members of families in which marriages have been arranged for personal reasons rather than for the convenience of a geneticist. If all the members of a family have the same allele for the
gene being studied, then no useful information can be obtained. For gene
mapping purposes it is therefore necessary to find families in which marriages
have occurred, by chance, between individuals with different alleles. This is
much more likely if the gene being studied has 290 rather than 2 alleles.

3.2.2 DNA markers for genetic mapping
Genes are very useful markers but they are by no means ideal. One problem,
especially with larger genomes such as those of vertebrates and flowering
plants, is that a map based entirely on genes is not very detailed. This would
be true even if every gene could be mapped because in most eukaryotic
genomes the genes are widely spaced out with large gaps between them (see
Figure 7.12. The problem is made worse by the fact that only a fraction of the
total number of genes exist in allelic forms that can be distinguished conveniently. Gene maps are therefore not very comprehensive. We need other
types of marker.
Mapped features that are not genes are called DNA markers. As with gene
markers, a DNA marker must have at least two alleles to be useful. There are
three types of DNA sequence feature that satisfy this requirement: restriction
fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence length polymorphisms (SSLPs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).

Restriction fragment length polymorphisms
RFLPs were the first type of DNA marker to be studied. Recall that restriction
enzymes cut DNA molecules at specific recognition sequences (Section
2.1.2). This sequence specificity means that treatment of a DNA molecule
with a restriction enzyme should always produce the same set of fragments.
This is not always the case with genomic DNA molecules because some
restriction sites are polymorphic, existing as two alleles, with one allele displaying the correct sequence for the restriction site and therefore being cut
when the DNA is treated with the enzyme, and the second allele having a
sequence alteration so the restriction site is no longer recognized. The result
of the sequence alteration is that the two adjacent restriction fragments
remain linked together after treatment with the enzyme, leading to a length
polymorphism (Figure 3.4). This is an RFLP, and its position on a genome map
can be worked out by following the inheritance of its alleles, just as is done
when genes are used as markers. There are thought to be about 105 RFLPs in
a mammalian genome.
In order to score an RFLP, it is necessary to determine the size of just one or
two individual restriction fragments against a background of many irrelevant fragments. This is not a trivial problem: an enzyme such as EcoRI, with
a six-nucleotide recognition sequence, should cut approximately once every
46 = 4096 bp and so would give almost 800,000 fragments when used with
human DNA. After separation by agarose gel electrophoresis, these 800,000
fragments produce a smear of DNA and the RFLP cannot be distinguished.

Figure 3.5 Two methods for scoring an
RFLP. (A) RFLPs can be scored by Southern
hybridization. The DNA is digested with the
appropriate restriction enzyme and
separated in an agarose gel. The smear of
restriction fragments is transferred to a
nylon membrane and probed with a piece
of DNA that spans the polymorphic
restriction site. If the site is absent then a
single restriction fragment is detected (lane
2); if the site is present then two fragments
are detected (lane 3). (B) The RFLP can
also be typed by PCR, using primers that
anneal either side of the polymorphic
restriction site. After the PCR, the products
are treated with the appropriate restriction
enzyme and then analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis. If the site is absent then
one band is seen on the agarose gel (lane
2); if the site is present then two bands are
seen (lane 3).

Southern hybridization, using a probe that spans the polymorphic restriction site, provides one way of visualizing the RFLP (Figure 3.5A), but nowadays PCR is more frequently used. The primers for the PCR are designed so
that they anneal either side of the polymorphic site, and the RFLP is typed by
treating the amplified fragment with the restriction enzyme and then running a sample in an agarose gel (Figure 3.5B).
(A) Two variants of an SSLP

Simple sequence length polymorphisms

Allele 1

SSLPs are arrays of repeat sequences that display length variations, different
alleles containing different numbers of repeat units (Figure 3.6A). Unlike
RFLPs, SSLPs can be multiallelic as each SSLP can have a number of different
length variants. There are two types of SSLP:

TCTGAGAGAGGC

Allele 2

G

Minisatellites, also known as variable number of tandem repeats
(VNTRs), in which the repeat unit is up to 25 bp in length.

G

Microsatellites, or simple tandem repeats (STRs), whose repeats are
shorter, usually 13 bp or less.

Microsatellites are more popular than minisatellites as DNA markers, for two
reasons. First, minisatellites are not spread evenly around the genome but
tend to be found more frequently in the telomeric regions at the ends of chromosomes. In geographic terms, this is equivalent to trying to use a map of
lighthouses to find one’s way around the middle of an island. Microsatellites

called a microsatellite. In allele 1 the motif “GA” is repeated three times, and in allele 2 it is
repeated five times. (B) Typing an STR by PCR. The STR and part of the surrounding
sequence is amplified and the size of the product determined by agarose gel electrophoresis
or capillary electrophoresis. In the agarose gel, lane A contains the PCR product and lane B
contains DNA markers that show the sizes of the bands given after PCR of the two alleles.
The band in lane A is the same size as the larger of the two DNA markers, showing that the
DNA that was tested contained allele 2. The results of capillary electrophoresis are displayed
as an electrophoretogram, the position of the peak indicating the size of the PCR product.
The electrophoretogram is automatically calibrated against size markers so the precise length
of the PCR product can be calculated. Image courtesy of Susan Thaw.

are more conveniently spaced throughout the genome. Second, the quickest
way to type a length polymorphism is by PCR, but PCR typing is much
quicker and more accurate with sequences less than 300 bp in length. Most
minisatellite alleles are longer than this because the repeat units are relatively large and there tend to be many of them in a single array, so PCR products several kilobases in length are needed to type them. Microsatellites used
as DNA markers typically consist of 10–30 copies of a repeat that is no longer
than 6 bp in length, and so are much more amenable to analysis by PCR.
There are 5 ¥ 105 microsatellites with repeat units of 6 bp of less in the
human genome.
When examined by PCR, the allele present at an STR is revealed by the precise
length of the PCR product (Figure 3.6B). The length variations can be visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, but standard gel electrophoresis is a cumbersome procedure that is difficult to automate, and is hence unsuitable for
the high-throughput analyses that are demanded by modern genome
research. Instead, STRs are usually typed by capillary electrophoresis in a
polyacrylamide gel (see Technical Note 4.1). Most capillary electrophoresis
systems use fluorescence detection, so a fluorescent label is attached to one
or both of the primers before the PCR is carried out (Technical Note 2.1). After
PCR, the product is loaded into the capillary system and run past a fluorescence detector. A computer attached to the detector correlates the time of
passage of the PCR product with equivalent data for a set of size markers, and
hence identifies the precise length of the product.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms
These are positions in a genome where some individuals have one
nucleotide (e.g., a G) and others have a different nucleotide (e.g., a C) (Figure
3.7). There are vast numbers of SNPs in every genome (over four million in
the human genome), some of which also give rise to RFLPs, but many of
which do not because the sequence in which they lie is not recognized by
any restriction enzyme.
Any one of the four nucleotides could be present at any one position in the
genome, so it might be imagined that each SNP should have four alleles.
Theoretically this is possible but in practice most SNPs exist as just two variants. This is because each SNP originates when a point mutation (Section
16.1) occurs in a genome, converting one nucleotide into another. If the
mutation is in the reproductive cells of an individual, then one or more of
that individual’s offspring might inherit the mutation and, after many generations, the SNP may eventually become established in the population. But
there are just two alleles—the original sequence and the mutated version.
For a third allele to arise, a new mutation must occur at the same position in
the genome in another individual, and this individual and his or her offspring must reproduce in such a way that the new allele becomes established. This scenario is not impossible but it is unlikely: consequently the
vast majority of SNPs are biallelic. This disadvantage is more than outweighed by the huge number of SNPs present in each genome—in most
eukaryotes, at least one for every 10 kb of DNA. SNPs therefore enable very
detailed genome maps to be constructed.
The importance that SNPs have acquired in genome research has stimulated the development of rapid methods for their typing. Several of these

methods are based on oligonucleotide hybridization analysis. An oligonucleotide is a short, single-stranded DNA molecule, usually less than 50
nucleotides in length, that is synthesized in the test tube. If the conditions
are just right, then an oligonucleotide will hybridize with another DNA molecule only if the oligonucleotide forms a completely base-paired structure
with the second molecule. If there is a single mismatch—a single position
within the oligonucleotide that does not form a base pair—then hybridization does not occur (Figure 3.8A). Oligonucleotide hybridization can therefore discriminate between the two alleles of an SNP. Various screening strategies based on oligonucleotide hybridization have been devised, including
the following:
G

DNA chip technology (Technical Note 3.1) makes use of a wafer of glass or
silicon, 2.0 cm2 or less in area, carrying many different oligonucleotides in
a high-density array. The DNA to be tested is labeled with a fluorescent
marker and pipetted onto the surface of the chip. Hybridization is
detected by examining the chip with a fluorescence microscope, the positions at which the fluorescent signal is emitted indicating which oligonucleotides have hybridized with the test DNA. Many SNPs can therefore be
scored in a single experiment.

G

Solution hybridization techniques are carried out in the wells of a
microtiter tray, each well containing a different oligonucleotide, using a
detection system that can discriminate between unhybridized, singlestranded DNA and the double-stranded product that results when an
oligonucleotide hybridizes to the test DNA. Several systems have been
developed, one of which makes use of a pair of labels comprising a fluorescent dye and a compound that quenches the fluorescent signal when
brought into close proximity with the dye. The dye is attached to one end
of an oligonucleotide and the quenching compound to the other end.
Normally there is no fluorescence because the oligonucleotide is designed
in such a way that the two ends base-pair to one another, placing the
quencher next to the dye (Figure 3.8B). Hybridization between oligonucleotide and test DNA disrupts this base pairing, moving the quencher
away from the dye and enabling the fluorescent signal to be generated.

Other typing methods make use of an oligonucleotide whose mismatch with
the SNP occurs at its extreme 5¢ or 3¢ end. Under the appropriate conditions,
an oligonucleotide of this type will hybridize to the mismatched template

Figure 3.8 SNP typing by oligonucleotide hybridization analysis. (A) Under highly
stringent hybridization conditions, a stable hybrid occurs only if the oligonucleotide is able to
form a completely base-paired structure with the target DNA. If there is a single mismatch
then the hybrid does not form. To achieve this level of stringency, the incubation
temperature must be just below the melting temperature, or Tm, of the oligonucleotide. At
temperatures above the Tm, even the fully base-paired hybrid is unstable. At more than 5˚C
below the Tm, mismatched hybrids might be stable. The Tm for the oligonucleotide shown
in the figure would be about 58˚C. The Tm in ˚C is calculated from the formula Tm = (4 ¥
number of G and C nucleotides) + (2 ¥ number of A and T nucleotides). This formula
gives a rough indication of the Tm for oligonucleotides of 15–30 nucleotides in length. (B)
One way of typing an SNP by solution hybridization. The oligonucleotide probe has two
end-labels. One of these is a fluorescent dye and the other is a quenching compound. The
two ends of the oligonucleotide base-pair to one another, so the fluorescent signal is
quenched. When the probe hybridizes to its target DNA, the ends of the molecule become
separated, enabling the fluorescent dye to emit its signal. The two labels are called
“molecular beacons.”

Technical Note 3.1 DNA microarrays and chips
High-density arrays of DNA molecules for parallel hybridization analyses
DNA microarrays and chips are designed to allow many
hybridization experiments to be performed in parallel. Their
main applications have been in the screening of polymorphisms such as SNPs (Section 3.2.2) and comparing the
RNA populations of different cells (Section 6.1.2).
Although the terminology is inexact, microarrays and chips
are, strictly speaking, two distinct types of matrix. In both
architectures, a large number of DNA probes, each one
with a different sequence, are immobilized at defined positions on a solid surface. The probes can be synthetic
oligonucleotides or other short DNA molecules such as
cDNAs or PCR products. These can be spotted onto a glass
microscope slide or a piece of nylon membrane to form a
microarray. With this approach, only a relatively low density
can be achieved—typically 6400 spots as an 80 ¥ 80 array
in an area of 18 ¥ 18 mm, which is sufficient for examining
RNA populations but less applicable to the high-throughput
analyses needed to type SNPs.
To prepare really high-density arrays, oligonucleotides are
synthesized in situ on the surface of a wafer of glass or silicon, resulting in a DNA chip. The normal method for
oligonucleotide synthesis involves adding nucleotides oneby-one to the growing end of an oligonucleotide, the
sequence determined by the order in which the nucleotide
substrates are added to the reaction mixture. If used for
synthesis on a chip, this method would result in every
oligonucleotide having the same sequence. Instead, modified nucleotide substrates are used—ones that have to be
light-activated before they will attach to the end of a growing oligonucleotide. The nucleotides are added one after

another to the chip surface, photolithography being used
to direct pulses of light onto individual positions in the array
and hence to determine which of the growing oligonucleotides will be extended by addition of the particular
nucleotide added at each step (Figure T3.1). A density of
up to 300,000 oligonucleotides per cm2 is possible, so if
used for SNP screening, 150,000 polymorphisms can be
typed in a single experiment, presuming there are oligonucleotides for both alleles of each SNP.
Chips and microarrays are not complicated to use. The chip
or array is incubated with labeled target DNA to allow
hybridization to take place. The positions at which hybridization to the target DNA occurs are determined by scanning
the surface and recording the points at which the signal
emitted by the label is detected. Radioactive labels can be
used, signals being detected electronically by phosphorimaging, but this provides only low resolution and is not
suitable for high-density chips. Higher resolution can be
achieved with fluorescent labeling and detection by laser
scanning or fluorescence confocal microscopy (Figure T3.2).

DNA with a short, non-base-paired “tail” (Figure 3.9A). This feature is utilized
in two different ways:
G

The oligonucleotide ligation assay (OLA) makes use of two oligonucleotides that anneal adjacent to one another, with the 3¢ end of one of
these oligonucleotides positioned exactly at the SNP. This oligonucleotide
will form a completely base-paired structure if one version of the SNP is
present in the template DNA, and when this occurs the oligonucleotide
can be ligated to its partner (Figure 3.9B). If the DNA being examined contains the other allele of the SNP, then the 3¢ nucleotide of the test oligonucleotide will not anneal to the template and no ligation occurs. The allele
is therefore typed by determining if the ligation product is synthesized,
usually by running the postreaction mixture in a capillary electrophoresis
system, as described above for STR typing.

G

The amplification refractory mutation system, or ARMS test, is based on
the same principle as OLA, but in this method the test oligonucleotide is
one of a pair of PCR primers. If the test primer anneals to the SNP then it
can be extended by Taq polymerase and the PCR can take place, but if it
does not anneal, because the alternative version of the SNP is present,
then no PCR product is generated (Figure 3.9C).

3.2.3 Linkage analysis is the basis of genetic mapping
Now that we have assembled a set of markers with which to construct a
genetic map, we can move on to look at the mapping techniques themselves.
These techniques are all based on genetic linkage, which in turn derives from
the seminal discoveries in genetics made in the mid-nineteenth century by
Gregor Mendel.

Genetic mapping is based on the principles of inheritance as first described
by Gregor Mendel in 1865. From the results of his breeding experiments with
Figure 3.10 Homozygosity and heterozygosity. Mendel studied seven pairs of contrasting
characteristics in his pea plants, one of which was violet and white flower color, as shown
here. (A) Pure-breeding plants always give rise to flowers with the parental color. These
plants are homozygotes, each possessing a pair of identical alleles, denoted here by VV for
violet flowers and WW for white flowers. (B) When two pure-breeding plants are crossed,
only one of the phenotypes is seen in the F1 generation. Mendel deduced that the genotype
of the F1 plants was VW, so V is the dominant allele and W is the recessive allele.

Genomes Chapter 3

peas, Mendel concluded that each pea plant possesses two alleles for each
gene, but displays only one phenotype. This is easy to understand if the plant
is pure-breeding, or homozygous, for a particular characteristic, as it then
possesses two identical alleles and displays the appropriate phenotype
(Figure 3.10A). However, Mendel showed that if two pure-breeding plants
with different phenotypes are crossed then all the progeny (the F1 generation)
display the same phenotype. These F1 plants must be heterozygous, meaning
that they possess two different alleles, one for each phenotype—one allele
inherited from the mother and one from the father. Mendel postulated that in
this heterozygous condition one allele overrides the effects of the other allele:
he therefore described the phenotype expressed in the F1 plants as being
dominant over the second, recessive phenotype (Figure 3.10B).
Mendel’s interpretation of the heterozygous condition is perfectly correct for
the pairs of alleles that he studied, but we now appreciate that this simple
dominant–recessive rule can be complicated by situations that he did not
encounter. These include:
G

G

Incomplete dominance, where the heterozygous form displays a phenotype intermediate between the two homozygous forms. Flower color in
plants such as carnations (but not peas) is an example: when red carnations are crossed with white ones, the F1 heterozygotes are neither red nor
white, but pink (Figure 3.11A).
Codominance, where the heterozygous form displays both of the
homozygous phenotypes. Human blood groups provide several examples
of codominance. For example, the two homozygous forms of the MN
series are M and N, with these individuals synthesizing only the M or N
blood glycoproteins, respectively. Heterozygotes, however, synthesize
both glycoproteins and hence are designated MN (Figure 3.11B).

As well as discovering dominance and recessiveness, Mendel carried out additional experiments that enabled him to establish his two Laws of Genetics.
The First Law states that alleles segregate randomly. In other words, if the
parent’s alleles are A and a, then a member of the F1 generation has the same
chance of inheriting A as it has of inheriting a. The Second Law is that pairs of
alleles segregate independently, so that inheritance of the alleles of gene A is
independent of inheritance of the alleles of gene B. Because of these laws, the
outcomes of genetic crosses are predictable (Figure 3.12).
When Mendel’s work was rediscovered in 1900, his Second Law worried the
early geneticists because it was soon established that genes reside on chromosomes, and it was realized that all organisms have many more genes than
chromosomes. Chromosomes are inherited as intact units, so it was reasoned

Figure 3.12 Mendel’s Laws enable the
outcome of genetic crosses to be
predicted. Two crosses are shown with
their predicted outcomes. In a monohybrid
cross, the alleles of a single gene are
followed, in this case allele T for tall pea
plants and allele t for short pea plants. T is
dominant and t is recessive. The grid shows
the predicted genotypes and phenotypes of
the F1 generation based on Mendel’s First
Law, which states that alleles segregate
randomly. When Mendel carried out this
cross he obtained 787 tall pea plants and
277 short plants, a ratio of 2.84:1. In the
dihybrid cross, two genes are followed. The
second gene determines the shape of the
peas, the alleles being R (round, the
dominant allele) and r (wrinkled, which is
recessive). The genotypes and phenotypes
shown are those predicted by Mendel’s First
and Second Laws, the latter stating that
pairs of alleles segregate independently.

Figure 3.13 Genes on the same

Genes A and B are on the same

therefore not apply to the inheritance of A

chromosome, so the Second Law will hold
for the inheritance of A and C, or B and C.
Mendel did not discover linkage because
the seven genes that he studied were each
on a different pea chromosome.

that the alleles of some pairs of genes will be inherited together because they
are on the same chromosome (Figure 3.13). This is the principle of genetic
linkage, and it was quickly shown to be correct, although the results did not
turn out exactly as expected. The complete linkage that had been anticipated
between many pairs of genes failed to materialize. Pairs of genes were either
inherited independently, as expected for genes in different chromosomes, or
if they showed linkage, then it was only partial linkage: sometimes they were
inherited together and sometimes they were not (Figure 3.14). The resolution
of this contradiction between theory and observation was the critical step in
the development of genetic mapping techniques.

Partial linkage is explained by the behavior of chromosomes
during meiosis
The critical breakthrough was achieved by Thomas Hunt Morgan, who made
the conceptual leap between partial linkage and the behavior of chromosomes when the nucleus of a cell divides. Cytologists in the late-nineteenth
century had distinguished two types of nuclear division: mitosis and meiosis.
Mitosis is more common, being the process by which the diploid nucleus of a
somatic cell divides to produce two daughter nuclei, both of which are
diploid (Figure 3.15). Approximately 1017 mitoses are needed to produce all
the cells required during a human lifetime. Before mitosis begins, each chromosome in the nucleus is replicated, but the resulting daughter chromosomes do not immediately break away from one another. To begin with they
remain attached at their centromeres. The daughters do not separate until

nuclei. Obviously it is important that each of the new nuclei receives a complete set of chromosomes, and most of the intricacies of mitosis appear to be
devoted to achieving this end.
Mitosis illustrates the basic events occurring during nuclear division, but it is
the distinctive features of meiosis that interest us. Meiosis occurs only in reproductive cells, and results in a diploid cell giving rise to four haploid gametes,
each of which can subsequently fuse with a gamete of the opposite sex during
sexual reproduction. The fact that meiosis results in four haploid cells whereas
mitosis gives rise to two diploid cells is easy to explain: meiosis involves two
nuclear divisions, one after the other, whereas mitosis is just a single nuclear
division. This is an important distinction, but the critical difference between
mitosis and meiosis is more subtle. Recall that in a diploid cell there are two,
separate copies of each chromosome (Chapter 1). We refer to these as pairs of
homologous chromosomes. During mitosis, homologous chromosomes
remain separate from one another, each member of the pair replicating and
being passed to a daughter nucleus independently of its homolog. In meiosis,
however, the pairs of homologous chromosomes are by no means independent. During prophase I, each chromosome lines up with its homolog to form a
bivalent (Figure 3.16). This occurs after each chromosome has replicated, but
before the replicated structures split, so the bivalent in fact contains four chromosome copies, each of which is destined to find its way into one of the four
gametes that will be produced at the end of the meiosis. Within the bivalent,
the chromosome arms (the chromatids) can undergo physical breakage and
exchange of segments of DNA. The process is called crossing-over, or recombination, and was discovered by the Belgian cytologist Janssens in 1909. This
was just two years before Morgan started to think about partial linkage.
How did the discovery of crossing-over help Morgan explain partial linkage? To
understand this we need to think about the effect that crossing-over can have

Figure 3.15 Mitosis. During interphase
(the period between nuclear divisions) the
chromosomes are in their extended form
(Section 7.1.1). At the start of mitosis the
chromosomes condense, and by late
prophase have formed structures that are
visible with the light microscope. Each
chromosome has already undergone DNA
replication but the two daughter
chromosomes are held together by the
centromere. During metaphase the nuclear
membrane breaks down (in most
eukaryotes) and the chromosomes line up
in the center of the cell. Microtubules now
draw the daughter chromosomes towards
either end of the cell. In telophase, nuclear
membranes re-form around each collection
of daughter chromosomes. The result is that
the parent nucleus has given rise to two
identical daughter nuclei. For simplicity, just
one pair of homologous chromosomes is
shown; one member of the pair is red, the
other is blue.

Figure 3.16 Meiosis. The events involving
one pair of homologous chromosomes are
shown; one member of the pair is red, the
other is blue. At the start of meiosis the
chromosomes condense and each
homologous pair lines up to form a bivalent.
Within the bivalent, crossing-over might
occur, involving breakage of chromosome
arms and exchange of DNA. Meiosis then
proceeds by a pair of mitotic nuclear
divisions that result initially in two nuclei,
each with two copies of each chromosome
still attached at their centromeres, and finally
in four nuclei, each with a single copy of
each chromosome. These final products of
meiosis, the gametes, are therefore haploid.

on the inheritance of genes. Let us consider two genes, each of which has two
alleles. We will call the first gene A and its alleles A and a, and the second gene
B with alleles B and b. Imagine that the two genes are located on chromosome
number 2 of Drosophila melanogaster, the species of fruit fly studied by
Morgan. We are going to follow the meiosis of a diploid nucleus in which one
copy of chromosome 2 has alleles A and B, and the second has a and b. This
situation is illustrated in Figure 3.17. Consider the two alternative scenarios:
G

A crossover does not occur between genes A and B. If this is what happens,
then two of the resulting gametes will contain chromosome copies with
alleles A and B, and the other two will contain a and b. In other words, two
of the gametes have the genotype AB and two have the genotype ab.

G

A crossover does occur between genes A and B. This leads to segments of
DNA containing gene B being exchanged between homologous chromosomes. The eventual result is that each gamete has a different genotype:
one AB, one aB, one Ab, and one ab.

Now think about what would happen if we looked at the results of meiosis in
one hundred identical cells. If crossovers never occur then the resulting
gametes will have the following genotypes:
200 AB
200 ab
This is complete linkage: genes A and B behave as a single unit during meiosis. But if (as is more likely) crossovers occur between A and B in some of the

Genomes Chapter 3

nuclei, then the allele pairs will not be inherited as single units. Let us say
that crossovers occur during 40 of the 100 meioses. The following gametes
will result:

The linkage is not complete, it is only partial. As well as the two parental
genotypes (AB, ab) we see gametes with recombinant genotypes (Ab, aB).

From partial linkage to genetic mapping
Once Morgan had understood how partial linkage could be explained by
crossing-over during meiosis, he was able to devise a way of mapping the relative positions of genes on a chromosome. In fact the most important work
was done not by Morgan himself but by an undergraduate in his laboratory,
Arthur Sturtevant. Sturtevant assumed that crossing-over was a random
event, there being an equal chance of it occurring at any position along a pair
of lined-up chromatids. If this assumption is correct, then two genes that are
close together will be separated by crossovers less frequently than two genes
that are more distant from one another. Furthermore, the frequency with
which the genes are unlinked by crossovers will be directly proportional to
how far apart they are on their chromosome. The recombination frequency
is therefore a measure of the distance between two genes. If you work out the
recombination frequencies for different pairs of genes, you can construct a
map of their relative positions on the chromosome (Figure 3.18).

3.2.4 Linkage analysis with different types of organism
To see how linkage analysis is actually carried out, we need to consider three
quite different situations:
G

Linkage analysis with species such as fruit flies and mice, with which we
can carry out planned breeding experiments.

G

Linkage analysis with humans, with whom we cannot carry out planned
experiments but instead can make use of family pedigrees.

It turns out that Sturtevant’s assumption about the randomness of crossovers
was not entirely justified. Comparisons between genetic maps and the actual
positions of genes on DNA molecules, as revealed by physical mapping and
DNA sequencing, have shown that some regions of chromosomes, called
recombination hotspots, are more likely to be involved in crossovers than
others. This means that a genetic map distance does not necessarily indicate
the physical distance between two markers (see Figure 3.25). Also, we now
realize that a single chromatid can participate in more than one crossover at
the same time, but that there are limitations on how close together these
crossovers can be, leading to more inaccuracies in the mapping procedure.
Despite these qualifications, linkage analysis usually makes correct deductions about gene order, and distance estimates are sufficiently accurate to
generate genetic maps that are of value as frameworks for genome sequencing projects. We will therefore move on to consider how linkage analysis is
carried out with different types of organism.

The first type of linkage analysis is the modern counterpart of the method
developed by Morgan and his colleagues. The method is based on analysis of
the progeny of experimental crosses set up between parents of known genotypes and is, at least in theory, applicable to all eukaryotes. Ethical considerations preclude this approach with humans, and practical problems such as
the length of the gestation period and the time taken for the newborn to reach
maturity (and hence to participate in subsequent crosses) limit the effectiveness of the method with some animals and plants.
If we return to Figure 3.17 we see that the key to gene mapping is being able
to determine the genotypes of the gametes resulting from meiosis. In a few
situations this is possible by directly examining the gametes. For example, the
gametes produced by some microbial eukaryotes, including the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can be grown into colonies of haploid cells, whose
genotypes can be determined by biochemical tests. Direct genotyping of
gametes is also possible with higher eukaryotes if DNA markers are used, as
PCR can be carried out with the DNA from individual spermatozoa, enabling
RFLPs, SSLPs, and SNPs to be typed. Unfortunately, sperm typing is laborious.
Routine linkage analysis with higher eukaryotes is therefore carried out not
by examining the gametes directly but by determining the genotypes of the
diploid progeny that result from fusion of two gametes, one from each of a
pair of parents. In other words, a genetic cross is performed.

example is taken from the original
experiments carried out with fruit flies by
Arthur Sturtevant. All four genes are on the
X chromosome of the fruit fly.
Recombination frequencies between the
genes are shown, along with their deduced
map positions.

The complication with a genetic cross is that the resulting diploid progeny
are the product not of one meiosis but of two (one in each parent), and in
most organisms crossover events are equally likely to occur during production of the male and female gametes. Somehow we have to be able to disentangle from the genotypes of the diploid progeny the crossover events that
occurred in each of these two meioses. This means that the cross has to be
set up with care. The standard procedure is to use a test cross. This is illustrated in Figure 3.19, where we have set up a test cross to map the two genes
we met earlier: gene A (alleles A and a) and gene B (alleles B and b), both on
chromosome 2 of the fruit fly. The critical feature of a test cross is the genotypes of the two parents:
G

One parent is a double heterozygote. This means that all four alleles are
present in this parent: its genotype is AB/ab. This notation indicates that
one pair of the homologous chromosomes has alleles A and B, and the
other has a and b. Double heterozygotes can be obtained by crossing two
pure-breeding strains, for example AB/AB ¥ ab/ab.

G

The second parent is a pure-breeding double homozygote. In this parent,
both homologous copies of chromosome 2 are the same: in the example
shown in Figure 3.19, both have alleles a and b and the genotype of the
parent is ab/ab.

The double heterozygote has the same genotype as the cell whose meiosis
we followed in Figure 3.17. Our objective is therefore to infer the genotypes
of the gametes produced by this parent and to calculate the fraction that are
recombinants. Note that all the gametes produced by the second parent
(the double homozygote) will have the genotype ab regardless of whether
they are parental or recombinant gametes. Alleles a and b are both recessive, so meiosis in this parent is, in effect, invisible when the phenotypes of
the progeny are examined. This means that, as shown in Figure 3.19, the

Genomes Chapter 3

5:06 pm

Page 79

Genetic Mapping

phenotypes of the diploid progeny can be unambiguously converted into
the genotypes of the gametes from the double heterozygous parent. The test
cross therefore enables us to make a direct examination of a single meiosis
and hence to calculate a recombination frequency and map distance for the
two genes being studied.
The power of this type of linkage analysis is enhanced if more than two
markers are followed in a single cross. Not only does this generate recombination frequencies more quickly, it also enables the relative order of markers on a chromosome to be determined by simple inspection of the data.
This is because two recombination events are required to unlink the central
marker from the two outer markers in a series of three, whereas either of the
two outer markers can be unlinked by just a single recombination (Figure
3.20). A double recombination is less likely than a single one, so unlinking of
the central marker will occur relatively infrequently. A set of typical data
from a three-point cross is shown in Table 3.2. A test cross has been set up
between a triple heterozygote (ABC/abc) and a triple homozygote (abc/abc).
The most frequent progeny are those with one of the two parental genotypes, resulting from an absence of recombination events in the region containing the markers A, B, and C. Two other classes of progeny are relatively
frequent (51 and 63 progeny in the example shown). Both of these are presumed to arise from a single recombination. Inspection of their genotypes
shows that in the first of these two classes, marker A has become unlinked
from B and C, and in the second class, marker B has become unlinked from
A and C. The implication is that A and B are the outer markers. This is confirmed by the number of progeny in which marker C has become unlinked
from A and B. There are only two of these, showing that a double recombination is needed to produce this genotype. Marker C is therefore between
A and B.
Just one additional point needs to be considered. If, as in Figure 3.19 and
Table 3.2, genes whose alleles display dominance and recessiveness are
examined in a test cross, then the double or triple homozygous parent must
have alleles for the recessive phenotypes. If, on the other hand, codominant
markers are used, then the double homozygous parent can have any combination of homozygous alleles (e.g., AB/AB, Ab/Ab, aB/aB, or ab/ab). Figure
3.21, which gives an example of this type of test cross, shows the reason for
this. Note that DNA markers typed by PCR display what is, in effect, codominance: Figure 3.21 therefore shows a typical scenario encountered when linkage analysis is being carried out with DNA markers.

examining their phenotypes. Because the
double homozygous parent (Parent 2) has
both recessive alleles—a and b—it
effectively makes no contribution to the
phenotypes of the progeny. The phenotype
of each individual in the F1 generation is
therefore the same as the genotype of the
gamete from Parent 1 that gave rise to
that individual.

In this particular example, the double

Ab/Ab. The alleles present in each F1
individual are directly detected, for example
by PCR. These allele combinations enable
the genotype of the Parent 1 gamete that
gave rise to each individual to be deduced.

With humans it is, of course, impossible to preselect the genotypes of parents
and set up crosses designed specifically for mapping purposes. Instead, data
for the calculation of recombination frequencies have to be obtained by examining the genotypes of the members of successive generations of existing families. This means that only limited data are available, and their interpretation
is often difficult because a human marriage rarely results in a convenient test
cross, and often the genotypes of one or more family members are unobtainable because those individuals are dead or unwilling to cooperate.
The problems are illustrated by Figure 3.22. In this example, we are studying a genetic disease present in a family of two parents and six children.
Genetic diseases are frequently used as gene markers in humans, the disease state being one allele and the healthy state being a second allele. The
pedigree in Figure 3.22A shows us that the mother is affected by the disease,
as are four of her children. We know from family accounts that the maternal
grandmother also suffered from this disease, but both she and her husband—the maternal grandfather—are now dead. We can include them in
the pedigree, with slashes indicating that they are dead, but we cannot
obtain any further information on their genotypes. We know that the disease gene is present on the same chromosome as a microsatellite, which we
call M, four alleles of which—M1, M2, M3, and M4—are present in the living
family members. Our aim is to map the position of the disease gene relative
to the microsatellite.
To establish a recombination frequency between the disease gene and
microsatellite M, we must determine how many of the children are recombinants. If we look at the genotypes of the six children, we see that numbers 1,
3, and 4 have the disease allele and the microsatellite allele M1. Numbers 2
and 5 have the healthy allele and M2. We can therefore construct two alternative hypotheses. The first is that the two copies of the relevant homologous
chromosomes in the mother have the genotypes Disease–M1 and Healthy–M2;
therefore, children 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 have parental genotypes, and child 6 is the
one and only recombinant (Figure 3.22B). This would suggest that the disease
gene and the microsatellite are relatively closely linked and that crossovers
between them occur infrequently. The alternative hypothesis is that the
mother’s chromosomes have the genotypes Healthy–M1 and Disease–M2; this
would mean that children 1–5 are recombinants, and child 6 has the parental
genotype. This would mean that the gene and microsatellite are relatively far
apart on the chromosome. We cannot determine which of these hypotheses
is correct: the data are frustratingly ambiguous.
The most satisfying solution to the problem posed by the pedigree in Figure
3.22 would be to know the genotype of the grandmother. Let us pretend that
this is a soap-opera family and that the grandmother is not really dead. To
everyone’s surprise she reappears just in time to save the declining audience
ratings. Her genotype for microsatellite M turns out to be M1M5 (Figure 3.22C).
This tells us that the chromosome inherited by the mother has the genotype
Disease–M1. We can therefore conclude with certainty that Hypothesis 1 is correct and that only child 6 is a recombinant.
Resurrection of key individuals is not usually an option open to real-life geneticists, although DNA can be obtained from old pathology specimens such as
slides and Guthrie cards. Imperfect pedigrees are analyzed statistically, using a

measure called the lod score. This stands for logarithm of the odds that the
genes are linked, and is used primarily to determine if the two markers being
studied lie on the same chromosome—in other words if the genes are linked or
not. If the lod analysis establishes linkage then it can also provide a measure of
the most likely recombination frequency. Ideally the available data will derive
from more than one pedigree, increasing the confidence in the result. The
analysis is less ambiguous for families with larger numbers of children, and as
we saw in Figure 3.22, it is important that the members of at least three generations can be genotyped. For this reason, family collections have been established, such as the one maintained by the Centre d’Études du Polymorphisme
Humaine (CEPH) in Paris. The CEPH collection contains cultured cell lines
from families in which all four grandparents as well as at least eight secondgeneration children could be sampled. This collection is available for DNA
marker mapping by any researcher who agrees to submit the resulting data to
the central CEPH database.

Genetic mapping in bacteria
The final type of genetic mapping that we must consider is the strategy used
with bacteria. The main difficulty that geneticists faced when trying to develop

can be interpreted in two different ways:
Hypothesis 1 gives a low recombination
frequency and indicates that the disease
gene is tightly linked to microsatellite M.
Hypothesis 2 suggests that the disease gene
and microsatellite are much less closely
linked. In (C), the issue is resolved by the
reappearance of the maternal grandmother,
whose microsatellite genotype is consistent
only with Hypothesis 1.

(A) Conjugation

genetic mapping techniques for bacteria is that these organisms are normally
haploid, and so do not undergo meiosis. Some other way therefore had to be
devised to induce crossovers between homologous segments of bacterial
DNA. The answer was to make use of three natural methods that exist for
transferring pieces of DNA from one bacterium to another (Figure 3.23):

Nucleoid
G

In conjugation, two bacteria come into physical contact and one bacterium (the donor) transfers DNA to the second bacterium (the recipient). The transferred DNA can be a copy of some or possibly all of the
donor cell’s chromosome, or it could be a segment of chromosomal
DNA—up to 1 Mb in length—integrated in a plasmid. The latter is called
episome transfer.

G

Transduction involves transfer of a small segment of DNA—up to 50 kb or
so—from donor to recipient via a bacteriophage.

G

In transformation, the recipient cell takes up from its environment a fragment of DNA, rarely longer than 50 kb, released from a donor cell.

(C) Transformation

Figure 3.23 Three ways of achieving DNA
transfer between bacteria. (A) Conjugation
can result in transfer of chromosomal or
plasmid DNA from the donor bacterium to
the recipient. Conjugation involves physical
contact between the two bacteria, with
transfer thought to occur through a narrow
tube called the pilus. (B) Transduction is
the transfer of a small segment of the donor
cell’s DNA via a bacteriophage. (C)
Transformation is similar to transduction but
“naked” DNA is transferred. The events
illustrated in (B) and (C) are often
accompanied by death of the donor cell. In
(B), death occurs when the bacteriophages
emerge from the donor cell. In (C), release
of DNA from the donor cell is usually a
consequence of the cell’s death through
natural causes.

Biochemical markers are invariably used, the dominant or wild-type phenotype being possession of a biochemical characteristic (e.g., ability to synthesize tryptophan) and the recessive phenotype being the complementary
characteristic (e.g., inability to synthesize tryptophan). The gene transfer is
usually set up between a donor strain that possesses the wild-type allele and
a recipient with the recessive allele, transfer into the recipient strain being
monitored by looking for acquisition of the biochemical function specified by
the gene being studied. This is illustrated in Figure 3.24A, where we see a
functional gene for tryptophan biosynthesis being transferred from a wildtype bacterium (genotype described as trp+) to a recipient that lacks a functional copy of this gene (trp–). The recipient is called a tryptophan auxotroph
(the word used to describe a mutant bacterium that can survive only if provided with a nutrient—in this case, tryptophan—not required by the wild
type; see Section 16.1.2). After transfer, two crossovers are needed to integrate
the transferred gene into the recipient cell’s chromosome, converting the
recipient from trp– to trp+.
The precise details of the mapping procedure depend on the type of gene
transfer that is being used. During conjugation, DNA is transferred from
donor to recipient in the same way that a string is pulled through a tube. The
relative positions of markers on the DNA molecule can therefore be mapped
by determining the times at which the markers appear in the recipient cell.
In the example shown in Figure 3.24B, markers A, B, and C are transferred 8,
20, and 30 minutes after the beginning of conjugation, respectively. The
entire Escherichia coli chromosome takes approximately 100 minutes to
transfer. In contrast, transduction and transformation mapping enable
genes that are relatively close together to be mapped, because the transferred DNA segment is short (<50 kb), so the probability of two genes being
transferred together depends on how close together they are on the bacterial chromosome (Figure 3.24C).

3.3 Physical Mapping
A map generated by genetic techniques is rarely sufficient for directing the
sequencing phase of a genome project. This is for two reasons:

The resolution of a genetic map depends on the number of crossovers that
have been scored. This is not a major problem for microorganisms
because these can be obtained in huge numbers, enabling many
crossovers to be studied, resulting in a highly detailed genetic map in
which the markers are just a few kilobases apart. For example, when the
Escherichia coli genome sequencing project began in 1990, the latest
genetic map for this organism comprised over 1400 markers, an average of
1 per 3.3 kb. This was sufficiently detailed to direct the sequencing program without the need for extensive physical mapping. Similarly, the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae project was supported by a fine-scale genetic
map (approximately 1150 genetic markers, on average 1 per 10 kb). The
problem with humans and most other eukaryotes is that it is simply not
possible to obtain large numbers of progeny, so relatively few meioses can
be studied and the resolving power of linkage analysis is restricted. This
means that genes that are several tens of kilobases apart may appear at the
same position on the genetic map.

G

Genetic maps have limited accuracy. We touched on this point in Section
3.2.3 when we assessed Sturtevant’s assumption that crossovers occur at
random along chromosomes. This assumption is only partly correct
because the presence of recombination hotspots means that crossovers
are more likely to occur at some points rather than at others. The effect
that this can have on the accuracy of a genetic map was illustrated in 1992
when the complete sequence for Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome
III was published, enabling the first direct comparison to be made
between a genetic map and the actual positions of markers as shown by
DNA sequencing (Figure 3.25). There were considerable discrepancies,
even to the extent that one pair of genes had been ordered incorrectly by
genetic analysis. Bear in mind that S. cerevisiae is one of the two eukaryotes
(fruit fly is the second) whose genomes have been subjected to intensive
genetic mapping. If the yeast genetic map is inaccurate, then how precise
are the genetic maps of organisms subjected to less-detailed analysis?

mapped by hybridizing a probe containing the marker to intact chromosomes.

3.3.1 Restriction mapping
Genetic mapping using RFLPs as DNA markers can locate the positions of
polymorphic restriction sites within a genome (Section 3.2.2), but very few of
the restriction sites in a genome are polymorphic, so many sites are not
mapped by this technique (Figure 3.26). Could we increase the marker density on a genome map by using an alternative method to locate the positions
of some of the nonpolymorphic restriction sites? This is what restriction mapping achieves, although in practice the technique has limitations that mean it
is applicable only to relatively small DNA molecules. We will look first at the
technique, and then consider its relevance to genome mapping.

The simplest way to construct a restriction map is to compare the fragment
sizes produced when a DNA molecule is digested with two different restriction enzymes that recognize different target sequences. An example using the
restriction enzymes EcoRI and BamHI is shown in Figure 3.27. First, the DNA
molecule is digested with just one of the enzymes and the sizes of the resulting fragments measured by agarose gel electrophoresis. Next, the molecule is
digested with the second enzyme and the resulting fragments again sized in
an agarose gel. The results so far enable the number of restriction sites for
each enzyme to be worked out, but do not allow their relative positions to be
determined. Additional information is therefore obtained by cutting the DNA
molecule with both enzymes together. In the example shown in Figure 3.27,
this double restriction enables three of the sites to be mapped. However, a
problem arises with the larger EcoRI fragment because this contains two
BamHI sites and there are two alternative possibilities for the map location of
the outer one of these. The problem is solved by going back to the original
DNA molecule and treating it again with BamHI on its own, but this time preventing the digestion from going to completion by, for example, incubating
the reaction for only a short time or using a suboptimal incubation temperature. This is called a partial restriction and leads to a more complex set of
products, the complete restriction products now being supplemented with
partially restricted fragments that still contain one or more uncut BamHI
sites. In the example shown in Figure 3.27, the size of one of the partial
restriction fragments is diagnostic and the correct map can be identified.
A partial restriction usually gives the information needed to complete a
map, but if there are many restriction sites then this type of analysis

partial restriction by attaching markers to

the analysis, enabling the positions of
restriction sites to be determined directly
from the lengths of the labeled products.

becomes unwieldy, simply because there are so many different fragments to
consider. An alternative strategy is simpler because it enables the majority
of the fragments to be ignored. This is achieved by attaching a radioactive or
other type of marker to each end of the starting DNA molecule before carrying out the partial digestion. The result is that many of the partial restriction products become “invisible” because they do not contain an end-fragment and so do not show up when the agarose gel is screened for labeled
products (Figure 3.28). The sizes of the partial restriction products that are
visible enable unmapped sites to be positioned relative to the ends of the
starting molecule.

The scale of restriction mapping is limited by the sizes of the
restriction fragments
Restriction maps are easy to generate if there are relatively few cut sites for
the enzymes being used. However, as the number of cut sites increases, so
also do the numbers of single-, double-, and partial-restriction products
whose sizes must be determined and compared in order for the map to be
constructed. Computer analysis can be brought into play but problems still
eventually arise. A stage will be reached when a digest contains so many fragments that individual bands merge on the agarose gel, increasing the chances
of one or more fragments being measured incorrectly or missed out entirely.
If several fragments have similar sizes then even if they can all be identified,
it may not be possible to assemble them into an unambiguous map.
Restriction mapping is therefore more applicable to small rather than large
molecules, with the upper limit for the technique depending on the frequency of the restriction sites in the molecule being mapped. In practice, if
a DNA molecule is less than 50 kb in length it is usually possible to construct
an unambiguous restriction map for a selection of enzymes with sixnucleotide recognition sequences. Fifty kilobases is way below the minimum
size for bacterial or eukaryotic chromosomes, although it does cover a few
viral and organelle genomes, and whole-genome restriction maps have
indeed been important in directing sequencing projects with these small
molecules. Restriction maps are equally useful after bacterial or eukaryotic
genomic DNA has been cloned, if the cloned fragments are less than 50 kb in
length, because a detailed restriction map can then be built up as a preliminary to sequencing the cloned region. This is an important application of
restriction mapping in projects sequencing large genomes, but is there any
possibility of using restriction analysis for the more general mapping of
entire genomes larger than 50 kb?
The answer is a qualified “yes,” because the limitations of restriction mapping
can be eased slightly by choosing enzymes expected to have infrequent cut
sites in the target DNA molecule. These “rare cutters” fall into two categories:
G

A few restriction enzymes cut at seven- or eight-nucleotide recognition
sequences. Examples are SapI (5¢–GCTCTTC–3¢) and SgfI
(5¢–GCGATCGC–3¢). The enzymes with seven-nucleotide recognition
sequences would be expected, on average, to cut a DNA molecule with a
GC content of 50% once every 47 = 16,384 bp. The enzymes with eightnucleotide recognition sequences should cut once every 48 = 65,536 bp.
These figures compare with 46 = 4096 bp for enzymes with six-nucleotide
recognition sequences, such as BamHI and EcoRI. Cutters with seven- or
eight-nucleotide recognition sequences are often used in restriction

mapping of large molecules, but the approach is not as useful as it might
be simply because not many of these enzymes are known.
G

Enzymes can be used whose recognition sequences contain motifs that
are rare in the target DNA. Genomic DNA molecules do not have random
sequences and some molecules are significantly deficient in certain
motifs. For example, the sequence 5¢–CG–3¢ is rare in the genomes of vertebrates because vertebrate cells possess an enzyme that adds a methyl
group to carbon 5 of the C nucleotide in this sequence. Deamination of
the resulting 5-methylcytosine gives thymine (Figure 3.29). The consequence is that during vertebrate evolution, many of the 5¢–CG–3¢
sequences that were originally in these genomes have become converted
to 5¢–TG–3¢. Restriction enzymes that recognize a site containing 5¢–CG–3¢
therefore cut vertebrate DNA relatively infrequently. Examples are SmaI
(5¢–CCCGGG–3¢), which cuts human DNA once every 78 kb on average,
and BssHII (5¢–GCGCGC–3¢), which cuts once every 390 kb. Note that NotI,
a cutter with an eight-nucleotide recognition sequence, also targets
5¢–CG–3¢ sequences (recognition sequence 5¢–GCGGCCGC–3¢) and cuts
human DNA very rarely—approximately once every 10 Mb.

The potential of restriction mapping is therefore increased by using rare cutters. It is still not possible to construct restriction maps of the genomes of animals and plants, but it is feasible to use the technique with large cloned fragments, and with the smaller DNA molecules of prokaryotes and lower eukaryotes such as yeast and fungi.
If a rare cutter is used then it may be necessary to employ a special type of
agarose gel electrophoresis to study the resulting restriction fragments. This
is because the relationship between the length of a DNA molecule and its
migration rate in an electrophoresis gel is not linear, the resolution decreasing as the molecules get longer (Figure 3.30A). This means that it is not possible to separate molecules more than about 50 kb in length, because all of
these longer molecules run as a single, slowly migrating band in a standard
agarose gel. To separate them it is necessary to replace the linear electric field
used in conventional gel electrophoresis with a more complex field. An
example is provided by orthogonal field alternation gel electrophoresis
(OFAGE), in which the electric field alternates between two pairs of electrodes, each positioned at an angle of 45˚ to the length of the gel (Figure
3.30B). The DNA molecules still move down through the gel, but each change
in the field forces the molecules to realign. Shorter molecules realign more
quickly than longer ones and so migrate more rapidly through the gel. The
overall result is that molecules much longer than those separated by conventional gel electrophoresis can be resolved. Related techniques include CHEF
(contour clamped homogeneous electric fields) and FIGE (field inversion
gel electrophoresis).

Direct examination of DNA molecules for restriction sites
It is also possible to use methods other than electrophoresis to map restriction sites in DNA molecules. With the technique called optical mapping,
restriction sites are directly located by looking at the cut DNA molecules
with a microscope. The DNA must first be attached to a glass slide in such a
way that the individual molecules become stretched out, rather than
clumped together in a mass. There are various ways of doing this, including
gel stretching and molecular combing. To prepare gel-stretched DNA

fibers, chromosomal DNA is suspended in molten agarose and placed on a
microscope slide. As the gel cools and solidifies, the DNA molecules become
extended (Figure 3.31A). In molecular combing, the DNA fibers are prepared
by dipping a silicone-coated cover slip into a solution of DNA, leaving it for
5 minutes (during which time the DNA molecules attach to the cover slip by
their ends), and then removing the slip at a constant speed of 0.3 mm s–1
(Figure 3.31B). The force required to pull the DNA molecules through the
meniscus causes them to line up. Once in the air, the surface of the cover slip
dries, retaining the DNA molecules as an array of parallel fibers. After
stretching or combing, the immobilized DNA molecules are treated with a
restriction enzyme and then visualized by adding a fluorescent dye, such as
DAPI (4,6-diamino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride), which stains the DNA
so that the fibers can be seen when the slide is examined with a high-power
fluorescence microscope. The restriction sites in the extended molecules
gradually become gaps as the degree of fiber extension is reduced by the
natural springiness of the DNA, enabling the relative positions of the cuts to
be recorded.
Optical mapping was first applied to large DNA fragments cloned in YAC
and BAC vectors (Section 2.2.1). More recently, the feasibility of using this

technique with genomic DNA has been proven with studies of a 1 Mb chromosome of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, and the two chromosomes and single megaplasmid of the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans (see Table 8.2).

3.3.2 Fluorescent in situ hybridization
The optical mapping method described above provides a link to the second
type of physical mapping procedure that we will consider—FISH. As in optical mapping, FISH enables the position of a marker on a chromosome or
extended DNA molecule to be directly visualized. In optical mapping, the
marker is a restriction site and it is visualized as a gap in an extended DNA
fiber. In FISH, the marker is a DNA sequence that is visualized by hybridization with a fluorescent probe.

In situ hybridization with radioactive or fluorescent probes
In situ hybridization is a version of hybridization analysis (Section 2.1.2) in
which an intact chromosome is examined by probing it with a labeled DNA
molecule. The position on the chromosome at which hybridization occurs
provides information about the map location of the DNA sequence used as
the probe (Figure 3.32). For the method to work, the DNA in the chromosome must be made single-stranded (“denatured”) by breaking the base
pairs that hold the double helix together. Only then will the chromosomal
DNA be able to hybridize with the probe. The standard method for denaturing chromosomal DNA without destroying the morphology of the chromosome is to dry the preparation onto a glass microscope slide and then treat
with formamide.

In the early versions of in situ hybridization the probe was radioactively
labeled, but this procedure was unsatisfactory because, with a radioactive
label, it is difficult to achieve both sensitivity and resolution, two critical
requirements for successful in situ hybridization. Sensitivity requires that the
radioactive label has a high emission energy (an example of such a radiolabel
is 32P), but if the radiolabel has a high emission energy then it scatters its signal and so gives poor resolution. High resolution is possible if a radiolabel
with low emission energy such as 3H is used, but these radiolabels have such
low sensitivity that lengthy exposures are needed, leading to a high background and difficulties in discerning the genuine signal.
These problems were solved in the late 1980s by the development of nonradioactive, fluorescent DNA labels. These labels combine high sensitivity with
high resolution and are ideal for in situ hybridization. Fluorolabels with different colored emissions have been designed, making it possible to hybridize
a number of different probes to a single chromosome and distinguish their
individual hybridization signals, thus enabling the relative positions of the
probe sequences to be mapped (Figure 3.33). To maximize sensitivity, the
probes must be labeled as heavily as possible, which in the past has meant
that they must be quite lengthy DNA molecules—usually cloned DNA fragments of at least 40 kb. This requirement is less important now that techniques for achieving heavy labeling with shorter molecules have been developed. As far as the construction of a physical map is concerned, a cloned DNA
fragment can be looked upon as simply another type of marker, although in
practice the use of clones as markers adds a second dimension because the
cloned DNA is the material from which the DNA sequence is determined.

Mapping the positions of clones therefore provides a direct link between a
genome map and its DNA sequence.
If the probe is a long fragment of DNA then one potential problem, at least
with higher eukaryotes, is that it is likely to contain examples of repetitive
DNA sequences (Chapter 9) and so may hybridize to many chromosomal
positions, not just the specific point to which it is perfectly matched. To
reduce this nonspecific hybridization, before use the probe is mixed with
unlabeled DNA from the organism being studied. This DNA can simply be
total nuclear DNA (i.e., representing the entire genome) but it is better if a
fraction enriched for repeat sequences is used. The idea is that the unlabeled
DNA hybridizes to the repetitive DNA sequences in the probe, blocking these
so that the subsequent in situ hybridization is driven wholly by the unique
sequences. Nonspecific hybridization is therefore reduced or eliminated
entirely (Figure 3.34).

FISH in action

Figure 3.33 Using FISH in physical
mapping. A series of 18 different cosmid
clones have been labeled with different
fluorescent markers and hybridized to a
single pair of homologous chromosomes.
The chromosomes come from a metaphase
nucleus and hence are joined at their
centromeres. The relative positions of the
fluorescent signals enable the map locations
of the DNA fragments carried by each
cosmid to be determined. Image courtesy of
Octavian Henegariu.

FISH was originally used with metaphase chromosomes (Section 7.1). These
chromosomes, prepared from nuclei that are undergoing division, are highly
condensed and each chromosome in a set takes up a recognizable appearance, characterized by the position of its centromere and the banding pattern
that emerges after the chromosome preparation is stained (see Figure 7.5).
With metaphase chromosomes, a fluorescent signal obtained by FISH is
mapped by measuring its position relative to the end of the short arm of the
chromosome (the FLpter value). A disadvantage of this method is that the
highly condensed nature of metaphase chromosomes means that only lowresolution mapping is possible, two markers having to be at least 1 Mb apart
to be resolved as separate hybridization signals. This degree of resolution is
insufficient for the construction of useful chromosome maps, and the main
application of metaphase FISH has been in determining the chromosome on
which a new marker is located, and providing a rough idea of its map position, as a preliminary to finer-scale mapping by other methods.
For several years these “other methods” did not involve any form of FISH, but
since 1995 a range of higher-resolution FISH techniques has been developed.
With these techniques, higher resolution is achieved by changing the nature
of the chromosomal preparation being studied. If metaphase chromosomes
are too condensed for fine-scale mapping then we must use chromosomes
that are more extended. There are two ways of doing this:
G

Mechanically stretched chromosomes can be obtained by modifying the
preparative method used to isolate chromosomes from metaphase nuclei.
The inclusion of a centrifugation step generates shear forces which can
result in the chromosomes becoming stretched to up to 20 times their
normal length. Individual chromosomes are still recognizable and FISH
signals can be mapped in the same way as with normal metaphase chromosomes. The resolution is significantly improved and markers that are
200–300 kb apart can be distinguished.

G

Nonmetaphase chromosomes can be used because it is only during
metaphase that chromosomes are highly condensed: at other stages of the
cell cycle the chromosomes are naturally unpacked. Attempts have been
made to use prophase nuclei (see Figure 3.15) because in these the chromosomes are still sufficiently condensed for individual chromosomes to be
identified. In practice, however, these preparations provide no advantage

Genomes Chapter 3

over mechanically stretched chromosomes. Interphase chromosomes are
more useful because this stage of the cell cycle (between nuclear divisions)
is when the chromosomes are most unpacked. Resolution down to 25 kb is
possible, but chromosome morphology is lost so there are no external reference points against which to map the position of the probe. This technique is therefore used after preliminary map information has been
obtained, usually as a means of determining the order of a series of markers in a small region of a chromosome.
Interphase chromosomes contain the most unpacked of all cellular DNA
molecules. To improve the resolution of FISH to better than 25 kb it is therefore necessary to abandon intact chromosomes and instead use purified
DNA. This approach, called fiber-FISH, makes use of DNA prepared by gel
stretching or molecular combing (see Figure 3.31), and can distinguish markers that are less than 10 kb apart.

3.3.3 Sequence tagged site mapping
To generate a detailed physical map of a large genome we need, ideally, a
high-resolution mapping procedure that is rapid and not technically
demanding. Neither of the two techniques that we have considered so far—
restriction mapping and FISH—meets these requirements. Restriction mapping is rapid, easy, and provides detailed information, but it cannot be
applied to large genomes. FISH can be applied to large genomes, and modified versions such as fiber-FISH can give high-resolution data, but FISH is
difficult to carry out and data accumulation is slow, with map positions for
no more than three or four markers being obtained in a single experiment. If
detailed physical maps are to become a reality then we need a more powerful technique.
At present the most powerful physical mapping technique, and the one that
has been responsible for generation of the most detailed maps of large
genomes, is STS mapping. A sequence tagged site, or STS, is simply a short
DNA sequence, generally between 100 bp and 500 bp in length, that is easily
recognizable and occurs only once in the chromosome or genome being
studied. To map a set of STSs, a collection of overlapping DNA fragments from
a single chromosome or from the entire genome is needed. In the example
shown in Figure 3.35, a fragment collection has been prepared from a single
chromosome, with each point along the chromosome represented, on average, five times in the collection. The data from which the map will be derived
are obtained by determining which fragments contain which STSs. This can
be done by hybridization analysis but PCR is generally used because it is
quicker and has proven to be more amenable to automation. The chances of
two STSs being present on the same fragment will, of course, depend on how
close together they are in the genome. If they are very close then there is a
good chance that they will always be on the same fragment; if they are further
apart then sometimes they will be on the same fragment and sometimes they
will not (Figure 3.35). The data can therefore be used to calculate the distance
between two markers, in a manner analogous to the way in which map distances are determined by linkage analysis (Section 3.2.3). Remember that in
linkage analysis a map distance is calculated from the frequency at which
crossovers occur between two markers. STS mapping is essentially the same,
except that the map distance is based on the frequency at which breaks occur
between two markers.

The description of STS mapping given above leaves out some critical questions: What exactly is an STS? How is the DNA fragment collection obtained?

Any unique DNA sequence can be used as an STS
To qualify as an STS, a DNA sequence must satisfy two criteria. The first is that
its sequence must be known, so that a PCR assay can be set up to test for the
presence or absence of the STS on different DNA fragments. The second
requirement is that the STS must have a unique location in the chromosome
being studied, or in the genome as a whole if the DNA fragment set covers the
entire genome. If the STS sequence occurs at more than one position then the
mapping data will be ambiguous. Care must therefore be taken to ensure that
STSs do not include sequences found in repetitive DNA.

Figure 3.36 One method for preparing
cDNA. Most eukaryotic mRNAs have a
poly(A) tail at their 3¢ end (Section 12.2.1).
This series of A nucleotides is used as the
priming site for the first stage of cDNA
synthesis, carried out by reverse
transcriptase—a DNA polymerase that copies
an RNA template (Section 2.1.1). The primer
is a short, synthetic DNA oligonucleotide,
typically 20 nucleotides in length, made up
entirely of Ts (an “oligo(dT)” primer). When
the first strand synthesis has been
completed, the preparation is treated with
ribonuclease H, which specifically degrades
the RNA component of an RNA–DNA
hybrid. Under the conditions used, the
enzyme does not degrade all of the RNA,
instead leaving short segments that prime
the second DNA strand synthesis reaction,
this one catalyzed by DNA polymerase I.

These are easy criteria to satisfy and STSs can be obtained in many ways, the
most common sources being expressed sequence tags (ESTs), SSLPs, and
random genomic sequences.
G

Expressed sequence tags. These are short sequences obtained by analysis of cDNA clones. Complementary DNA is prepared by converting an
mRNA preparation into double-stranded DNA (Figure 3.36). Because the
mRNA in a cell is derived from protein-coding genes, cDNAs and the ESTs
obtained from them represent the genes that were being expressed in the
cell from which the mRNA was prepared. ESTs are looked upon as a rapid
means of gaining access to the sequences of important genes, and they
are valuable even if their sequences are incomplete. An EST can also be
used as an STS, assuming that it comes from a unique gene and not from
a member of a gene family in which all the genes have the same or very
similar sequences.

G

SSLPs. In Section 3.2.2 we examined the use of microsatellites and other
SSLPs in genetic mapping. SSLPs can also be used as STSs in physical
mapping. SSLPs that are polymorphic and have already been mapped by
linkage analysis are particularly valuable as they provide a direct connection between the genetic and physical maps.

G

Random genomic sequences. These are obtained by sequencing random
pieces of cloned genomic DNA, or simply by downloading sequences that
have been deposited in the databases.

Physical Mapping

Fragments of DNA for STS mapping
The second component of an STS mapping procedure is the collection of
DNA fragments spanning the chromosome or genome being studied. This
collection is sometimes called the mapping reagent and at present there are
two ways in which it can be assembled: as a clone library and as a panel of
radiation hybrids. We will consider radiation hybrids first.
A radiation hybrid is a rodent cell that contains fragments of chromosomes
from a second organism. The technology was initially developed with human
chromosomes, starting in the 1970s when it was discovered that exposure of
human cells to X-ray doses of 3000–8000 rad causes the chromosomes to
break up randomly into fragments, larger X-ray doses producing smaller fragments (Figure 3.37A). This treatment is of course lethal for the human cells,
but the chromosome fragments can be propagated if the irradiated cells are
subsequently fused with nonirradiated cells of a hamster or other rodent.
Fusion is stimulated either chemically, with polyethylene glycol, or by exposure to Sendai virus (Figure 3.37B). Not all of the hamster cells take up chromosome fragments, so a means of identifying the hybrids is needed. The routine selection process is to use a hamster cell line that is unable to make either
thymidine kinase (TK) or hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT),
deficiencies in either of these two enzymes being lethal when the cells are
grown in a medium containing a mixture of hypoxanthine, aminopterin, and
thymidine (HAT medium). After fusion, the cells are placed in HAT medium.
Those that grow are hybrid hamster cells that have acquired human DNA fragments that include genes for the human TK and HPRT enzymes, which are
synthesized inside the hybrids, enabling these cells to grow in the selective
medium. The treatment results in hybrid cells that contain a random selection
of human DNA fragments inserted into the hamster chromosomes. Typically
the fragments are 5–10 Mb in size, with each cell containing fragments equivalent to 15%–35% of the human genome. The collection of cells is called a
radiation hybrid panel and can be used as a mapping reagent in STS mapping,
provided that the PCR assay used to identify the STS does not amplify the
equivalent region of DNA from the hamster genome.
A second type of radiation hybrid panel, containing DNA from just one
human chromosome, can be constructed if the cell line that is irradiated is not
a human one but a second type of rodent hybrid. Cytogeneticists have developed a number of rodent cell lines in which a single human chromosome is
stably propagated in the rodent nucleus. If a cell line of this type (e.g., a mouse
cell line) is irradiated and fused with hamster cells, then the hybrid hamster
cells obtained after selection will contain either human or mouse chromosome fragments, or a mixture of both. The ones containing human DNA can
be identified by probing with a human-specific repeat sequence, such as the
short interspersed nuclear element (SINE) called Alu (Section 9.2.1), which
has a copy number of just over 1 million (see Table 9.3) and so occurs on average once every 3 kb in the human genome. Only cells containing human DNA
will hybridize to Alu probes, enabling the uninteresting mouse hybrids to be
discarded and STS mapping to be directed at the cells containing human
chromosome fragments.
Radiation hybrid mapping of the human genome was initially carried out
with chromosome-specific rather than whole-genome panels because it was
thought that fewer hybrids would be needed to map a single chromosome

than would be needed to map the entire genome. It turns out that a high-resolution map of a single human chromosome requires a panel of 100–200
hybrids, which is about the most that can be handled conveniently in a PCR
screening program. But whole-genome and single-chromosome panels are
constructed differently, the former involving irradiation of just human DNA,
and the latter requiring irradiation of a mouse cell containing much mouse
DNA and relatively little human DNA. This means that the human DNA content per hybrid is much lower in a single-chromosome panel than in a
whole-genome panel. It transpires that detailed mapping of the entire
human genome is possible with fewer than 100 whole-genome radiation
hybrids, so whole-genome mapping is no more difficult than single-chromosome mapping. Once this was realized, whole-genome radiation hybrids
became a central component of the mapping phase of the Human Genome
Project (Section 4.3). Whole-genome libraries have also been used for STS
mapping of other mammalian genomes and for those of the zebra fish and
the chicken.

A clone library can also be used as the mapping reagent for
STS analysis
A preliminary to the sequencing phase of a genome project is to break the
genome or isolated chromosomes into fragments and to clone each one in a
high-capacity vector that is able to handle large fragments of DNA (Section
2.2.1). This results in a clone library, a collection of DNA fragments, which in
the case of a genome project have an average size of several hundred kilobases. As well as supporting the sequencing work, this type of clone library
can also be used as a mapping reagent in STS analysis.
As with radiation hybrid panels, a clone library can be prepared from genomic
DNA, and so represents the entire genome, or a chromosome-specific library
can be made if the starting DNA comes from just one type of chromosome.
The latter is possible because individual chromosomes can be separated by
flow cytometry. To carry out this technique, dividing cells (ones with condensed chromosomes) are carefully broken open so that a mixture of intact
chromosomes is obtained. The chromosomes are then stained with a fluorescent dye. The amount of dye that a chromosome binds depends on its size, so
larger chromosomes bind more dye and fluoresce more brightly than smaller
ones. The chromosome preparation is diluted and passed through a fine aperture, producing a stream of droplets, each one containing a single chromosome. The droplets pass through a detector that measures the amount of fluorescence and hence identifies which droplets contain the particular chromosome being sought. An electric charge is applied to these drops, and no
others (Figure 3.38), enabling the droplets containing the desired chromosome to be deflected and separated from the rest. What if two different chromosomes have similar sizes, as is the case with human chromosomes 21 and
22? These can usually be separated if the dye that is used is not one that binds
nonspecifically to DNA, but instead has a preference for AT- or GC-rich
regions. Examples of such dyes are Hoechst 33258 and chromomycin A3,
respectively. Two chromosomes that are the same size rarely have identical
GC contents, and so can be distinguished by the amounts of AT- or GC-specific dye that they bind.
Compared with radiation hybrid panels, clone libraries have one important
advantage for STS mapping. This is the fact that the individual clones can

subsequently provide the DNA that is actually sequenced. The data resulting
from STS analysis, from which the physical map is generated, can equally well
be used to determine which clones contain overlapping DNA fragments,
enabling a clone contig to be built up (Figure 3.39; for other methods for
assembling clone contigs see Section 4.2.2). This assembly of overlapping
clones can be used as the base material for a lengthy, continuous DNA
sequence, and the STS data can later be used to anchor this sequence precisely onto the physical map. If the STSs also include SSLPs that have been
mapped by genetic linkage analysis then the DNA sequence, physical map,
and genetic map can all be integrated.

Summary
Genome maps provide the framework for sequencing projects because they
indicate the positions of genes and other recognizable features, and hence
enable the accuracy of an assembled DNA sequence to be checked. Genetic
maps are constructed by cross-breeding experiments and pedigree analysis,
and physical maps by direct examination of DNA molecules. In the first
genetic maps, the markers were genes whose alleles could be distinguished
because they gave rise to easily recognized phenotypes such as different eye
colors, or whose alleles could be distinguished by biochemical tests. Today,
DNA markers are also extensively used, these including restriction fragment
length polymorphisms (RFLPs), simple sequence length polymorphisms
(SSLPs), and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), all of which can be
typed quickly and easily by PCR. The relative positions of genes and DNA
markers on chromosomes are determined by linkage analysis. This technique is based on the original genetic discoveries made by Mendel and was
first developed for use with fruit flies in the early part of the twentieth century. Linkage analysis enables the recombination frequency between a pair
of markers to be determined, providing the data needed to deduce the relative positions of the markers on the genetic map. For many organisms, linkage analysis is carried out by following the inheritance of markers in planned
breeding experiments, but this is not possible with humans. Instead, genetic
mapping of the human genome depends on examination of marker inheritance in large families, a procedure called pedigree analysis. Genetic maps

have relatively poor resolution and tend to be inaccurate, and must be
refined by physical mapping if the map is to be used in a genome sequencing project. The positions of restriction sites in a small DNA molecule can be
determined by restriction mapping, but this is only of limited value with
eukaryotic chromosomes. Of greater utility is fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), in which a preparation of intact chromosomes, possibly ones
that have been elongated by mechanical stretching, is probed with a fluorescently labeled marker. The position at which hybridization occurs is determined by examining the preparation by confocal microscopy. The most
detailed physical maps are obtained by sequence tagged site (STS) content
mapping, which makes use of a mapping reagent, a collection of overlapping
DNA fragments that span an entire chromosome or genome. The map position of a marker is determined by identifying which fragments in the collection contain copies of the marker. The mapping reagent can be a library of
clones or a radiation hybrid panel.

DNA Sequence
4.3 The Human Genome Projects

When you have read Chapter 4, you should be able to:
Give detailed descriptions of the chain termination and thermal cycle methods for DNA
sequencing.
Describe in outline the chemical degradation and pyrosequencing methods, and state their
applications.
State the strengths and limitations of the shotgun, whole-genome shotgun, and clone contig
methods of genome sequencing.
Describe how a small bacterial genome can be sequenced by the shotgun method, using the
Haemophilus influenzae project as an example.
Outline the various ways in which a clone contig can be built up.
Explain the basis to the whole-genome shotgun approach to genome sequencing, with emphasis
on the steps taken to ensure that the resulting sequence is accurate.
Give an account of the development of the human genome projects up to the publication of the
finished chromosome sequences in 2004–2005.
Debate the ethical, legal, and social issues raised by the human genome projects.

The ultimate objective of a genome project is the complete DNA sequence for
the organism being studied, ideally integrated with the genetic and/or physical maps of the genome so that genes and other interesting features can be
located within the DNA sequence. This chapter describes the techniques and
research strategies that are used during the sequencing phase of a genome
project, when this ultimate objective is being directly addressed. Techniques
for sequencing DNA are clearly of central importance in this context and we
will begin the chapter with a detailed examination of sequencing methodology. This methodology is of little value, however, unless the short sequences
that result from individual sequencing experiments can be linked together in
the correct order to give the master sequences of the chromosomes that make
up the genome. The second part of this chapter therefore describes the strategies used to ensure that the master sequences are assembled correctly.

4.1 The Methodology for DNA Sequencing
There are several procedures for DNA sequencing, but by far the most popular
is the chain termination method first devised by Fred Sanger and colleagues
in the mid-1970s. Chain termination sequencing has gained preeminence for
several reasons, not least being the relative ease with which the technique can
be automated. As we will see later in this chapter, a genome project involves a
huge number of individual sequencing experiments and it would take many

Technical Note 4.1 Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
Separation of DNA molecules differing in length by just one nucleotide
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is used to examine the
families of chain-terminated DNA molecules resulting from
a sequencing experiment. Agarose gel electrophoresis
(Technical Note 2.2) cannot be used for this purpose
because it does not have the resolving power needed to
separate single-stranded DNA molecules that differ in
length by just one nucleotide. Polyacrylamide gels have
smaller pore sizes than agarose gels and allow precise separations of molecules from 10 to 1500 bp in length. As well
as DNA sequencing, polyacrylamide gels are also used for
other applications where fine-scale DNA separations are
required, for instance in the examination of amplification
products from PCRs directed at microsatellite loci, where
the products of different alleles might differ in size by just
two or three base pairs (see Figure 3.6). Polyacrylamide
gels can be prepared as slabs between two glass plates
held apart by spacers, or in long, thin columns suitable for
capillary electrophoresis (Figure T4.1).
A polyacrylamide gel consists of chains of acrylamide
monomers (CH2=CH–CO–NH2) cross-linked with N, N¢methylenebisacrylamide units (CH2=CH–CO–NH–CH2–

NH–CO–CH=CH2), the latter commonly called “bis.” The
pore size of the gel is determined by both the total concentration of monomers (acrylamide + bis) and the ratio of acrylamide to bis. In a 1 mm thick slab gel used for DNA
sequencing, a 6% gel with an acrylamide:bis ratio of 19:1 is
normally used because this allows resolution of singlestranded DNA molecules between 100 and 750 nucleotides
in length. About 650 nucleotides of sequence can therefore
be read from a single gel. The gel concentration can be
increased to 8% in order to read the sequence closer to the
primer (resolving molecules 50–400 nucleotides in length)
or decreased to 4% to read a more distant sequence
(500–1500 nucleotides from the primer). Polymerization of
the acrylamide:bis solution is initiated by ammonium persulfate and catalyzed by TEMED (N, N, N¢, N¢-tetramethylethylenediamine). Sequencing gels also contain urea, which is a
denaturant that prevents intrastrand base pairs from forming
in the chain-terminated molecules. This is important because
the change in conformation resulting from base pairing alters
the migration rate of a single-stranded molecule, so the strict
equivalence between the length of a molecule and its band
position, critical for reading the DNA sequence, is lost.

therefore essential if a project is to be completed in a reasonable timespan.

4.1.1 Chain termination DNA sequencing
Chain termination DNA sequencing is based on the principle that singlestranded DNA molecules that differ in length by just a single nucleotide can
be separated from one another by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(Technical Note 4.1). This means that it is possible to resolve a family of molecules, representing all lengths from 10 to 1500 nucleotides, into a series of
bands in a slab or capillary gel (Figure 4.1).

Chain termination sequencing in outline
The starting material for a chain termination sequencing experiment is a
preparation of identical, single-stranded DNA molecules. The first step is to
anneal a short oligonucleotide to the same position on each molecule, this
oligonucleotide subsequently acting as the primer for synthesis of a new DNA
strand that is complementary to the template (Figure 4.2A). The strand synthesis reaction, which is catalyzed by a DNA polymerase enzyme (see below)
and requires the four deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs—dATP,
dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP) as substrates, would normally continue until several
thousand nucleotides had been polymerized. This does not occur in a chain
termination sequencing experiment because, as well as the four deoxynucleotides, a small amount of each of four dideoxynucleotide triphosphates
(ddNTPs—ddATP, ddCTP, ddGTP, and ddTTP) is added to the reaction. Each
of these dideoxynucleotides is labeled with a different fluorescent marker.

DNA molecules by electrophoresis in a

marker and the bands have been visualized

the separation between individual DNA
molecules increases with their migration
toward the positive electrode. Therefore the
bands seen on the autoradiograph are
further apart toward the bottom of the
ladder. In practice, with either a slab gel or
capillary system, molecules up to about
1500 nucleotides in length can be
separated if the electrophoresis is continued
for long enough.

Chapter 4 Sequencing Genomes

The polymerase enzyme does not discriminate between deoxy- and
dideoxynucleotides, but once incorporated, a dideoxynucleotide blocks further strand elongation because it lacks the 3¢–hydroxyl group needed to form
a connection with the next nucleotide (Figure 4.2B). Because the normal
deoxynucleotides are also present, in larger amounts than the dideoxynucleotides, the strand synthesis does not always terminate close to the primer:
in fact several hundred nucleotides may be polymerized before a dideoxynucleotide is eventually incorporated. The result is a set of new molecules, all of
different lengths, and each ending in a dideoxynucleotide whose identity
indicates the nucleotide—A, C, G, or T—that is present at the equivalent position in the template DNA (Figure 4.2C).
To determine the DNA sequence, all that we have to do is identify the
dideoxynucleotide at the end of each chain-terminated molecule. This is
where the polyacrylamide gel comes into play. The DNA mixture is loaded
into a well of a polyacrylamide slab gel, or into a tube of a capillary gel system, and electrophoresis carried out to separate the molecules according to
their lengths. After separation, the molecules are run past a fluorescence
detector capable of discriminating the labels attached to the dideoxynucleotides (Figure 4.3A). The detector therefore determines if each molecule
ends in an A, C, G, or T. The sequence can be printed out for examination by
the operator (Figure 4.3B), or entered directly into a storage device for future
analysis. Automated sequencers with multiple capillaries working in parallel
can read up to 96 different sequences in a two-hour period, which means that

can be generated per machine per day. This, of course, requires round-theclock technical support, ideally with robotic devices used to prepare the
sequencing reactions and to load the reaction products into the sequencers.
If such a factory approach can be established and maintained then the data
needed to sequence an entire genome can be generated in a period of weeks.

Chain termination sequencing requires a single-stranded
DNA template
The template for a chain termination experiment is a single-stranded version
of the DNA molecule to be sequenced. There are several ways in which this
can be obtained:
G

G

G

The DNA can be cloned in a plasmid vector (Section 2.2.1). The resulting
DNA will be double-stranded so cannot be used directly in sequencing.
Instead, it must be converted into single-stranded DNA by denaturation
with alkali or by boiling. This is a common method for obtaining template
DNA for DNA sequencing, largely because cloning in a plasmid vector is
such a routine technique. A shortcoming is that it can be difficult to prepare plasmid DNA that is not contaminated with small quantities of bacterial DNA and RNA, which can act as spurious templates or primers in
the DNA sequencing experiment.
The DNA can be cloned in a bacteriophage M13 vector. Vectors based on
M13 bacteriophage are designed specifically for the production of singlestranded templates for DNA sequencing. M13 bacteriophage has a single-stranded DNA genome which, after infection of Escherichia coli bacteria, is converted into a double-stranded replicative form. The replicative form is copied until over 100 molecules are present in the cell, and
when the cell divides the copy number in the new cells is maintained by
further replication. At the same time, the infected cells continually
secrete new M13 phage particles—approximately 1000 per generation—
these phages containing the single-stranded version of the genome
(Figure 4.4). Cloning vectors based on M13 vectors are double-stranded
DNA molecules equivalent to the replicative form of the M13 genome.
They can be manipulated in exactly the same way as a plasmid cloning
vector. The difference is that cells that have been transfected with a recombinant M13 vector secrete phage particles containing single-stranded
DNA, this DNA comprising the vector molecule plus any additional DNA
that has been ligated into it. The phages therefore provide the template
DNA for chain termination sequencing. The one disadvantage is that DNA
fragments longer than about 3 kb suffer deletions and rearrangements
when cloned in an M13 vector, so the system can only be used with short
pieces of DNA.
The DNA can be cloned in a phagemid. This is a plasmid cloning vector
that contains, in addition to its plasmid origin of replication, the origin
from M13 or another bacteriophage with a single-stranded DNA genome.
If an E. coli cell contains both a phagemid and the replicative form of a
helper phage, the latter carrying genes for the phage replication enzymes
and coat proteins, then the phage origin of the phagemid becomes activated, resulting in synthesis of phage particles containing the singlestranded version of the phagemid. The double-stranded plasmid DNA is
therefore converted into single-stranded template DNA for DNA sequencing. This system avoids the instabilities of M13 cloning and can be used
with fragments of lengths up to 10 kb or more.

molecule and the single-stranded version
found in bacteriophage particles. The
replicative form can be manipulated in the
same way as a plasmid cloning vector
(Section 2.2.1), with new DNA inserted by
restriction followed by ligation. The
recombinant vector is introduced into
Escherichia coli cells by transfection. Once
inside an E. coli cell, the double-stranded
vector replicates and directs synthesis of
single-stranded copies, which are packaged
into phage particles and secreted from the
cell. The phage particles can be collected
from the culture medium after centrifuging
to pellet the bacteria. The protein coats of
the phages are removed by treating with
phenol, and the single-stranded version of
the recombinant vector is purified for use in
DNA sequencing.

Chapter 4 Sequencing Genomes

DNA polymerases for chain termination sequencing
Any template-dependent DNA polymerase is capable of extending a primer
that has been annealed to a single-stranded DNA molecule, but not all polymerases do this in a way that is useful for DNA sequencing. Three criteria in
particular must be fulfilled by a sequencing enzyme:
G

High processivity. This refers to the length of polynucleotide that is synthesized before the polymerase terminates through natural causes. A
sequencing polymerase must have high processivity so that it does not
dissociate from the template before incorporating a dideoxynucleotide.

G

Negligible or zero 5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease activity. Most DNA polymerases also
have exonuclease activities, meaning that they can degrade DNA polynucleotides as well as synthesize them (Section 2.1.1; see Figure 2.7). This is
a disadvantage in DNA sequencing because removal of nucleotides from
the 5¢ ends of the newly synthesized strands alters the lengths of these
strands, making it impossible to determine the correct sequence.

G

Negligible or zero 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity. This is also desirable so that
the polymerase does not remove the dideoxynucleotide at the end of a
completed strand. If this happens then the strand might be further
extended. The net result will be that there are few short strands in the
reaction mixture, and the sequence close to the primer will be unreadable.

These are stringent requirements and are not entirely met by any naturally
occurring DNA polymerase. Instead, artificially modified enzymes are generally used. The first of these to be developed was the Klenow polymerase,
which is a version of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase I from which the 5¢Æ3¢
exonuclease activity of the standard enzyme has been removed, either by
cleaving away the relevant part of the protein or by genetic engineering
(Section 2.1.1). The Klenow polymerase has relatively low processivity, limiting the length of sequence that can be obtained from a single experiment to
about 250 bp, and giving nonspecific products—strands that have terminated
naturally rather than by incorporation of a dideoxynucleotide—in the
sequencing reaction. The Klenow enzyme has therefore been superseded by
a modified version of the DNA polymerase encoded by bacteriophage T7, this
enzyme going under the tradename “Sequenase”. Sequenase has high processivity and no exonuclease activity, and also possesses other desirable features
such as a rapid reaction rate.

The primer determines the region of the template DNA that will be
sequenced
To begin a chain termination sequencing experiment, an oligonucleotide
primer is annealed onto the template DNA. The primer is needed because
template-dependent DNA polymerases cannot initiate DNA synthesis on a
molecule that is entirely single-stranded: there must be a short, doublestranded region to provide a 3¢ end onto which the enzyme can add new
nucleotides (Section 2.1.1).
The primer also plays the critical role of determining the region of the template molecule that will be sequenced. For most sequencing experiments a
“universal” primer is used, this being one that is complementary to the part
of the vector DNA immediately adjacent to the point into which new DNA is
ligated (Figure 4.5A). The same universal primer can therefore give the
sequence of any piece of DNA that has been ligated into the vector. Of course

universal primer anneals to the vector DNA
adjacent to the position at which new DNA
is inserted. A single universal primer can
therefore be used to sequence any DNA
insert, but only provides the sequence of
one end of the insert. (B) One way of
obtaining a longer sequence is to carry out
a series of chain termination experiments,
each with a different internal primer that
anneals within the DNA insert.

Universal primer
Internal primer

if this inserted DNA is longer than 750 bp or so then only a part of its sequence
will be obtained, but usually this is not a problem because the project as a
whole simply requires that a large number of short sequences are generated
and subsequently assembled into the contiguous master sequence. It is
immaterial whether or not the short sequences are the complete or only partial sequences of the DNA fragments used as templates. If double-stranded
plasmid DNA is being used to provide the template then, if desired, more
sequence can be obtained from the other end of the insert. Alternatively, it is
possible to extend the sequence in one direction by synthesizing a nonuniversal internal primer, designed to anneal at a position within the insert DNA
(Figure 4.5B). An experiment with this primer will provide a second short
sequence that overlaps the previous one.

Thermal cycle sequencing offers an alternative to the traditional
methodology
The discovery of thermostable DNA polymerases, which led to the development of PCR (Sections 2.1.1 and 2.3), has also resulted in new methodologies
for chain termination sequencing. In particular, the innovation called thermal cycle sequencing has two advantages over traditional chain termination
sequencing. First, it uses double-stranded rather than single-stranded DNA
as the starting material. Second, very little template DNA is needed, so the
DNA does not have to be cloned before being sequenced.

Template DNA

ddATP

ddA

Thermal cycle sequencing is carried out in a similar way to PCR, but just one
primer is used and the reaction mixture includes the four dideoxynucleotides
(Figure 4.6). Because there is only one primer, only one of the strands of the
starting molecule is copied, and the product accumulates in a linear fashion,
not exponentially as is the case in a real PCR. The presence of the dideoxynucleotides in the reaction mixture causes chain termination, as in the standard
methodology, and the family of resulting strands can be analyzed and the
sequence read in the usual way.

4.1.2 Alternative methods for DNA sequencing
Although most sequencing is carried out by the chain termination method,
other techniques remain important for specific applications. We will examine
two of these alternative techniques: the chemical degradation method
which, like chain termination sequencing, was devised in the 1970s, and
pyrosequencing, which is a more recent invention.

strands, along with the products of the C, G,
and T reactions, are electrophoresed using
standard methodology (see Figure 4.3).

Figure 4.7 Intrastrand base pairing can
interfere with chain termination
sequencing. In this example, the template
DNA can form a stem-loop structure
because its sequence enables a series of
intrastrand base pairs to form. This stemloop blocks progress of the DNA
polymerase, resulting in nonspecific chain
termination.

Chemical degradation sequencing
One limitation of chain termination sequencing is that it may not be able to
provide an accurate sequence if the template DNA is able to form intrastrand
base pairs (Figure 4.7). Intrastrand base pairs can block the progress of the
DNA polymerase, reducing the amount of strand synthesis that occurs, and
can also alter the mobility of the chain-terminated molecules during electrophoresis, meaning that the order in which the molecules pass the detector
is no longer determined solely by their length. Intrastrand base pairs do not
hinder chemical degradation sequencing, so this method can be used as an
alternative when such problems arise.
The chemical degradation method is similar to chain termination sequencing
in that the sequence is determined by examining the lengths of molecules
whose terminal nucleotide is known. However, these molecules are generated
in a totally different manner, by treatment with chemicals that cut specifically
at a particular nucleotide. This means that at least four separate sequencing
reactions must be carried out, one for each nucleotide.
The starting material is double-stranded DNA, which is first labeled by
attaching a radioactive phosphorus group to the 5¢ end of each strand (Figure
4.8A). Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is then added and the DNA heated to 90˚C.
This breaks the base pairing between the strands, enabling them to be separated from one another by gel electrophoresis, the basis to this being that one
of the strands probably contains more purine nucleotides than the other and
is therefore slightly heavier and runs more slowly during the electrophoresis.
One strand is purified from the gel and divided into four samples, each of
which is treated with one of the cleavage reagents. To illustrate the procedure,
we will follow the “G” reaction (Figure 4.8B). First, the molecules are treated
with dimethyl sulfate, which attaches a methyl group to the purine ring of G
nucleotides. Only a limited amount of dimethyl sulfate is added, the objective
being to modify, on average, just one G residue per polynucleotide. At this
stage the DNA strands are still intact, cleavage not occurring until a second
chemical—piperidine—is added. Piperidine removes the modified purine
ring and cuts the DNA molecule at the phosphodiester bond immediately
upstream of the baseless site that is created. The result is a set of cleaved DNA
molecules, some of which are labeled and some of which are not. The labeled
molecules all have one end in common and one end determined by the cut
sites, the latter indicating the positions of the G nucleotides in the DNA molecules that were cleaved. Similar approaches are used to generate additional
families of cleaved molecules, though these are usually not simply “A,” “T,”
and “C” families as problems have been encountered in developing chemical
treatments to cut specifically at A or T. The four reactions that are carried out
are therefore usually “G,” “A + G,” “C,” and “C + T”. This complicates things but
does not affect the accuracy of the sequence that is determined.
The family of molecules generated in each reaction is loaded into a lane of a
polyacrylamide slab gel and, after electrophoresis, the positions of the bands
in the gel are visualized by autoradiography (see Technical Note 2.1). The
band that has moved the furthest represents the smallest piece of DNA. In the
example shown in Figure 4.8C, this band lies in the “A + G” lane. There is no
equivalent-sized band in the “G” lane, so the first nucleotide in the sequence
is “A”. The next size position is occupied by two bands, one in the “C” lane and
one in the “C + T” lane: the second nucleotide is therefore “C” and the

sequence so far is “AC”. The sequence reading can be continued up to the
region of the gel where individual bands were not separated.

Pyrosequencing is used for rapid determination of very short
sequences
Pyrosequencing does not require electrophoresis or any other fragment separation procedure and so is more rapid than either chain termination or
chemical degradation sequencing. It can only generate a few tens of base
pairs per experiment, but it is becoming an important technique in situations
where many short sequences must be generated as quickly as possible, for
example in SNP typing (Section 3.2.2).
In pyrosequencing, the template is copied in a straightforward manner without added dideoxynucleotides. As the new strand is being made, the order in
which the deoxynucleotides are incorporated is detected, so the sequence can
be “read” as the reaction proceeds. The addition of a deoxynucleotide to the
end of the growing strand is detectable because it is accompanied by release
of a molecule of pyrophosphate, which can be converted by the enzyme sulfurylase into a flash of chemiluminescence. Of course, if all four deoxynucleotides were added at once then flashes of light would be seen all the time
and no useful sequence information would be obtained. Each deoxynucleotide is therefore added separately, one after the other, with a nucleotidase
enzyme also present in the reaction mixture so that if a deoxynucleotide is not
incorporated into the polynucleotide then it is rapidly degraded before the
next one is added (Figure 4.9). This procedure makes it possible to follow the
order in which the deoxynucleotides are incorporated into the growing
strand. The technique sounds complicated, but it simply requires that a repetitive series of additions be made to the reaction mixture, precisely the type of
procedure that is easily automated. Detection of the chemiluminescence is
very sensitive, so each reaction can be in a very small volume, perhaps just
one picoliter. This means that up to 1.6 million reactions can be carried out
in parallel on a 6.4 cm2 slide, enabling 25 million nucleotides of sequence to
be obtained in four hours, a rate of sequence generation some 100 times faster
than is possible by the chain termination method.

4.2 Assembly of a Contiguous DNA Sequence
The next question to address is how the master sequence of a chromosome,
possibly several tens of megabases in length, can be assembled from the multitude of short sequences generated by chain termination sequencing. We
addressed this issue at the start of Chapter 3 and established that the relatively short genomes of prokaryotes can be assembled by the shotgun
method, which involves breaking the DNA molecule into fragments, determining the sequence of each one, and using a computer to search for overlaps from which the master sequence is built up (see Figure 3.1 and Section
4.2.1). This approach has now been used with over 200 prokaryotic genomes,
but might lead to errors if applied to larger eukaryotic genomes, mainly
because the presence of repetitive sequences in eukaryotic genomes complicates the search for sequence overlaps and could result in segments of the
genome being assembled incorrectly (see Figure 3.2). To avoid these errors,
the approach referred to as the whole-genome shotgun method uses a map to
aid assembly of the master sequence (see Figure 3.3 and Section 4.2.3).
Whole-genome shotgun sequencing has been used successfully with several
eukaryotic genomes, including the fruit-fly and human genomes, but it is
generally accepted that the greatest degree of accuracy is achieved with the
clone contig method. In this approach, the genome is broken down into segments, each with a known position on the genome map, before sequencing is
carried out (see Figure 3.3 and Section 4.2.2). We will start by examining how
the shotgun method has been applied to prokaryotic genomes.

4.2.1 Sequence assembly by the shotgun method
The straightforward approach to sequence assembly is to build up the master sequence directly from the short sequences obtained from individual
sequencing experiments, simply by examining the sequences for overlaps
(see Figure 3.1). This is called the shotgun method. It does not require any
prior knowledge of the genome and so can be carried out in the absence of a
genetic or physical map.

The potential of the shotgun method was proven by the
Haemophilus influenzae sequence

Haemophilus
influenzae

During the early 1990s there was extensive debate about whether the shotgun
method would work in practice, many molecular biologists being of the opinion that the amount of data handling needed to compare all the minisequences and identify overlaps, even with the smallest genomes, would be
beyond the capabilities of existing computer systems. These doubts were laid
to rest in 1995 when the sequence of the 1830 kb genome of the bacterium
Haemophilus influenzae was published.

Extract DNA

Sonicate

The H. influenzae genome was sequenced entirely by the shotgun method and
without recourse to any genetic or physical map information. The strategy
used to obtain the sequence is shown in Figure 4.10. The first step was to break
the genomic DNA into fragments by sonication, a technique that uses highfrequency sound waves to make random cuts in DNA molecules. The fragments were then electrophoresed, and those in the size range 1.6–2.0 kb were
purified from the agarose gel and ligated into a plasmid vector. From the
resulting library, 19,687 clones were taken at random and 28,643 sequencing
experiments were carried out, the number of sequencing experiments being
greater than the number of plasmids because both ends of some inserts were
sequenced. Of these sequencing experiments, 16% were considered to be failures because they resulted in less than 400 bp of sequence. The remaining
24,304 sequences gave a total of 11,631,485 bp, corresponding to six times the
length of the H. influenzae genome, this amount of redundancy being deemed
necessary to ensure complete coverage. Sequence assembly required 30 hours
on a computer with 512 Megabytes of random access memory (RAM), and
resulted in 140 lengthy, contiguous sequences, each of these sequence contigs
representing a different, nonoverlapping portion of the genome.
The next step was to join up pairs of contigs by obtaining sequences from the
gaps between them (Figure 4.11). First, the library was checked to see if there
were any clones whose two end-sequences were located in different contigs.
If such a clone could be identified, then additional sequencing of its insert
would close the “sequence gap” between the two contigs (Figure 4.11A). In
fact, there were 99 clones in this category, so 99 of the gaps could be closed
without too much difficulty.

This left 42 gaps, which probably consisted of DNA sequences that were

these “physical gaps” a second clone library was prepared, this one with a different type of vector. Rather than using another plasmid, in which the
uncloned sequences would probably still be unstable, the second library was
prepared in a bacteriophage l vector (Section 2.2.1). This new library was

Figure 4.10 The way in which the shotgun method was used to obtain the DNA
sequence of the Haemophilus influenzae genome. H. influenzae DNA was sonicated, and
fragments with sizes between 1.6 kb and 2.0 kb were purified from an agarose gel and
ligated into a plasmid vector to produce a clone library. End-sequences were obtained from
clones taken from this library, and a computer was used to identify overlaps between
sequences. This resulted in 140 sequence contigs, which were assembled into the
complete genome sequence, as shown in Figure 4.11.

individual sequence contigs. (A)
“Sequence gaps” are ones that can be
closed by further sequencing of clones
already present in the library. In this
example, the end-sequences of contigs 1
and 2 lie within the same plasmid clone, so
further sequencing of this DNA insert with
internal primers (see Figure 4.5B) will
provide the sequence to close the gap. (B)
“Physical gaps” are stretches of sequence
that are not present in the clone library,
probably because these regions are
unstable in the cloning vector that was
used. Two strategies for closing these gaps
are shown. On the left, a second clone
library, prepared with a bacteriophage l
vector rather than a plasmid vector, is
probed with oligonucleotides corresponding
to the ends of the contigs. Oligonucleotides
1 and 7 both hybridize to the same clone,
whose insert must therefore contain DNA
spanning the gap between contigs 1 and 4.
On the right, PCRs are carried out with pairs
of oligonucleotides. Only numbers 1 and 7
give a PCR product, confirming that the
contig ends represented by these two
oligonucleotides are close together in the
genome. The PCR product or the insert
from the l clone could be sequenced to
close the gap between contigs 1 and 4.

CONCLUSION:
Contigs 1 and 4 are adjacent

probed with 84 oligonucleotides, one at a time, these 84 oligonucleotides having sequences identical to the sequences at the ends of the unlinked contigs
(Figure 4.11B). The rationale was that if two oligonucleotides hybridized to the
same l clone then the ends of the contigs from which they were derived must
lie within that clone, and sequencing the DNA in the l clone would therefore
close the gap. Twenty-three of the 42 physical gaps were dealt with in this way.
A second strategy for gap closure was to use pairs of oligonucleotides, from
the set of 84 described above, as primers for PCRs of H. influenzae genomic
DNA. Some oligonucleotide pairs were selected at random, and those spanning a gap were identified simply from whether or not they gave a PCR product (see Figure 4.11B). Sequencing these PCR products closed the relevant
gaps. Other primer pairs were chosen on a more rational basis. For example,
oligonucleotides were used as Southern hybridization probes (see Figure 2.11)

with H. influenzae DNA cut with a variety of restriction endonucleases, and
pairs that hybridized to similar sets of restriction fragments were identified.
The two members of an oligonucleotide pair identified in this way must be
contained within the same restriction fragments and so are likely to lie close
together on the genome. This means that the pair of contigs that the oligonucleotides are derived from are adjacent, and the gap between the contigs can
be spanned by a PCR of genomic DNA using the two oligonucleotides as
primers, which will provide the template DNA for gap closure.
The demonstration that a small genome can be sequenced relatively rapidly
by the shotgun method led to a sudden plethora of completed microbial
genomes. These projects demonstrated that shotgun sequencing can be set
up on a production-line basis, with each team member having his or her individual task in DNA preparation, carrying out the sequencing reactions, or
analyzing the data. This strategy resulted in the 580 kb genome of Mycoplasma
genitalium being sequenced by five people in just eight weeks, and it is now
accepted that a few months should be ample time to generate the complete
sequence of any genome less than about 5 Mb in size, even if nothing is known
about the genome before the project begins. The strengths of the shotgun
method are therefore its speed and its ability to work in the absence of a
genetic or physical map.

4.2.2 Sequence assembly by the clone contig method
The clone contig method is looked on as the conventional method for obtaining the sequence of a eukaryotic genome, and it has also been used with those
microbial genomes that have previously been mapped by genetic and/or
physical means. In the clone contig method, the genome is broken into fragments of up to 1.5 Mb in length, usually by partial restriction (Section 3.3.1),
and these fragments are cloned in a high-capacity vector such as a BAC
(Section 2.2.1). A clone contig is built up by identifying clones containing
overlapping fragments, which are then individually sequenced by the shotgun method. Ideally the cloned fragments are anchored onto a genetic
and/or physical map of the genome, so that the sequence data from the contig can be checked and interpreted by looking for features (e.g., STSs, SSLPs,
genes) known to be present in a particular region.

Clone contigs can be built up by chromosome walking, but the
method is laborious
The simplest way to build up an overlapping series of cloned DNA fragments
is to begin with one clone from a library, identify a second clone whose
insert overlaps with the insert in the first clone, then identify a third clone
whose insert overlaps with the second clone, and so on. This is the basis of
chromosome walking, which was the first method devised for assembly of
clone contigs.
Chromosome walking was originally used to move relatively short distances
along DNA molecules, using clone libraries prepared with l or cosmid vectors. The most straightforward approach is to use the insert DNA from the
starting clone as a hybridization probe to screen all the other clones in the
library. Clones whose inserts overlap with the probe give positive hybridization signals, and their inserts can be used as new probes to continue the walk
(Figure 4.12).

Figure 4.12 Chromosome walking. The
library comprises 96 clones, each containing
a different insert. To begin the walk, the
insert from one of the clones is used as a
hybridization probe against all the other
clones in the library. In the example shown,
clone A1 is the probe; it hybridizes to itself
and to clones E7 and F6. The inserts from
the last two clones must therefore overlap
with the insert from clone A1. To continue
the walk, the probing is repeated but this
time with the insert from clone F6. The
hybridizing clones are A1, F6, and B12,
showing that the insert from B12 overlaps
with the insert from F6.

The main problem that arises is that if the probe contains a repeat sequence
then it will hybridize not only to overlapping clones but also to nonoverlapping clones whose inserts contain copies of the repeat. The extent of this nonspecific hybridization can be reduced by blocking the repeat sequences by
prehybridization with unlabeled genomic DNA (see Figure 3.34), but this
does not completely solve the problem, especially if the walk is being carried
out with long inserts from a high-capacity vector such as a BAC. For this reason, intact inserts are rarely used for chromosome walks with human DNA
and similar DNAs, which have a high frequency of repeat sequences. Instead,
a fragment from the end of an insert is used as the probe, there being less
chance of a repeat occurring in a short end-fragment compared with the
insert as a whole. If complete confidence is required then the end-fragment
can be sequenced before use to ensure that no repetitive DNA is present.

Figure 4.13 Chromosome walking by
PCR. The two oligonucleotides anneal within
the end region of insert number 1. They are
used in PCRs with all the other clones in the
library. Only clone 15 gives a PCR product,
showing that the inserts in clones 1 and 15
overlap. The walk would be continued by
sequencing the fragment from the other
end of clone 15, designing a second pair of
oligonucleotides, and using these in a new
set of PCRs with all the other clones.

If the end-fragment has been sequenced then the walk can be speeded up by
using PCR rather than hybridization to identify clones with overlapping
inserts. Primers are designed from the sequence of the end-fragment and
used in attempted PCRs with all the other clones in the library. A clone that
gives a PCR product of the correct size must contain an overlapping insert
(Figure 4.13). To speed up the process even more, rather than performing a
PCR with each individual clone, groups of clones are mixed together in such
a way that unambiguous identification of overlapping inserts can still be
made. The method is illustrated in Figure 4.14, in which a library of 960 clones
has been prepared in ten microtiter trays, each tray comprising 96 wells in an
8 ¥ 12 array, with one clone per well. PCRs are carried out as follows:

As explained in the legend to Figure 4.14, these 296 PCRs provide enough information to identify which of the 960 clones give products and which do not.
Ambiguities arise only if a substantial number of clones turn out to be positive.

More rapid methods for clone contig assembly
Even when the screening step is carried out by the combinatorial PCR
approach shown in Figure 4.14, chromosome walking is a slow process and it
is rarely possible to assemble contigs of more than 15 to 20 clones by this
method. The procedure has been extremely valuable in positional cloning,
where the objective is to walk from a mapped site to an interesting gene that is
known to be no more than a few megabases distant. It has been less valuable
for assembling clone contigs across entire genomes, especially with the complex genomes of higher eukaryotes. So what alternative methods are there?
The main alternative is to use a clone fingerprinting technique. Clone fingerprinting provides information on the physical structure of a cloned DNA
fragment, this physical information or “fingerprint” being compared with
equivalent data from other clones, enabling those with similarities—possibly

117

Figure 4.14 Combinatorial screening of
clones in microtiter trays. In this example,
a library of 960 clones has to be screened
by PCR. Rather than carrying out 960
individual PCRs, the clones are grouped as
shown and just 296 PCRs are performed. In
most cases, the results enable positive
clones to be identified unambiguously. In
fact, if there are few positive clones, then
sometimes they can be identified by just
the “row” and “column” PCRs. For example,
if positive PCRs are obtained with tray 2 row
A, tray 6 row D, tray 2 column 7, and tray 6
column 9, then it can be concluded that
there are two positive clones, one in tray 2
well A7 and one in tray 6 well D9. The
“well” PCRs are needed if there are two or
more positive clones in the same tray.

indicating overlaps—to be identified. One or a combination of the following
techniques is used (Figure 4.15):
G

Restriction patterns can be generated by digesting clones with a variety
of restriction enzymes and separating the products in an agarose gel. If
two clones contain overlapping inserts then their restriction fingerprints
will have bands in common, as both will contain fragments derived from
the overlap region.

G

Repetitive DNA fingerprints can be prepared by analyzing a set of restriction fragments by Southern hybridization (Section 2.1.2) with probes specific for one or more types of repeat sequence. As with restriction fingerprints, overlaps are identified by looking for two clones that have some
hybridizing bands in common.

G

Repetitive DNA PCR, or interspersed repeat element PCR (IRE-PCR),
uses primers that anneal within repeat sequences and so amplify the single-copy DNA between two neighboring repeats. Because repeat
sequences are not evenly spaced in a genome, the sizes of the products
obtained after repetitive DNA PCR can be used as a fingerprint in comparisons with other clones in order to identify potential overlaps. With human
DNA, the repeats called Alu elements (Section 9.2.1) are often used
because these occur, on average, once every 3 kb. An Alu-PCR of a human
BAC insert of 150 kb would therefore be expected to give approximately 50
PCR products of various sizes, resulting in a detailed fingerprint.

G

STS content mapping is particularly useful because it can result in a clone
contig that is anchored onto a physical map of STS locations. PCRs
directed at individual STSs (Section 3.3.3) are carried out with each member of a clone library. Presuming the STS is single copy in the genome,
then all clones that give PCR products must contain overlapping inserts.

4.2.3 Whole-genome shotgun sequencing
The whole-genome shotgun method was first proposed by Craig Venter and
colleagues as a means of speeding up the acquisition of contiguous sequence
data for large genomes such as the human genome and those of other eukaryotes. Experience with conventional shotgun sequencing (Section 4.2.1) had
shown that if the total length of sequence that is generated is between 6.5 and
8 times the length of the genome being studied, then the resulting sequence
contigs will span over 99.8% of the genome, with a few gaps that can be closed
by methods such as those developed during the Haemophilus influenzae project (see Figure 4.11). This implies that 70 million individual sequences each
500 bp or so in length, corresponding to a total of 35,000 Mb, would be sufficient if the random approach were taken with a mammalian genome of size
between 3000 Mb and 3500 Mb. Seventy million sequences is not an impossibility: in fact, with 60 automatic sequencers, each determining 96 sequences
every two-hour period of every day, the task could be achieved in three years.
Could 70 million sequences be assembled correctly? If the conventional shotgun method is used with such a large number of fragments, and no reference
is made to a genome map, then the answer is certainly no. The huge amount
of computer time needed to identify overlaps between the sequences, and the
errors, or at best uncertainties, caused by the extensive repetitive DNA content of most eukaryotic genomes (see Figure 3.2), would make the task
impossible. But with reference to a map, it might be possible to assemble the
minisequences in the correct way.

Key features of whole-genome shotgun sequencing
The most time-consuming part of a shotgun sequencing project is the phase
when individual sequence contigs are joined by closure of sequence gaps and
physical gaps (see Figure 4.11). To minimize the amount of gap closure that is
needed, the whole-genome shotgun method makes use of at least two clone
libraries, prepared with different types of vector. At least two libraries are used
because, with any cloning vector, it is anticipated that some fragments will
not be cloned due to incompatibility problems that prevent vectors containing these fragments from being propagated. Different types of vector suffer
from different problems, so fragments that cannot be cloned in one vector
can often be cloned if a second vector is used. Generating sequence from
fragments cloned in two different vectors should therefore improve the overall coverage of the genome.
What about the problems that repeat elements pose for sequence assembly?
We highlighted this issue in Chapter 3 as the main argument against the use
of shotgun sequencing with eukaryotic genomes, because of the possibility
that jumps between repeat units will lead to parts of a repetitive region being
left out, or an incorrect connection being made between two separate pieces
of the same or different chromosomes (see Figure 3.2). Several possible solutions to this problem have been proposed, but the most successful strategy is
to ensure that one of the clone libraries contains fragments that are longer
than the longest repeat sequences in the genome being studied. For example,
one of the plasmid libraries used when this method was applied to the

Figure 4.16 Avoiding errors when the
whole-genome shotgun approach is
used. In Figure 3.2B, we saw how easy it
would be to “jump” between repeat
sequences when assembling the master
sequence by the standard shotgun method.
The result of such an error would be to lose
all the sequence between the two repeats
that had mistakenly been linked together.
This type of error is avoided in the wholegenome shotgun method by ensuring that
the two end-sequences of a cloned DNA
fragment (of size 10 kb or so) both appear
on the master sequence at their expected
positions. If one of the end-sequences is
missing, then an error has been made
when assembling the master sequence.

intermediates in sequence assembly by the
whole-genome shotgun approach. Two
scaffolds are shown. Each comprises a
series of sequence contigs separated by
sequence gaps, with the scaffolds
themselves separated by physical gaps. (B)
Sequence gaps lie between paired-end
reads—a pair of minisequences from the
two ends of a single cloned fragment—and
therefore can be closed by further
sequencing of the cloned DNA.

Drosophila genome contained inserts with an average size of 10 kb, because
most Drosophila repeat sequences are 8 kb or less. Sequence jumps, from one
repeat sequence to another, are avoided by ensuring that the two endsequences of each 10 kb insert are at their appropriate positions in the master sequence (Figure 4.16).
The initial result of sequence assembly is a series of scaffolds (Figure 4.17A),
each scaffold comprising a set of sequence contigs separated by sequence
gaps that lie between paired-end reads—the minisequences from the two
ends of a single cloned fragment—and so are gaps that can be closed by further sequencing of that fragment (Figure 4.17B). The scaffolds themselves are
separated by physical gaps, which are more difficult to close because they
represent sequences that are not in the clone libraries. The marker content of
each scaffold is used to determine its position on the genome map. For example, if the locations of STSs in the genome map are known then a scaffold can
be positioned by determining which STSs it contains. If a scaffold contains
STSs from two noncontiguous parts of the genome then an error has
occurred during sequence assembly. The accuracy of sequence assembly can
be further checked by obtaining end-sequences from fragments of 100 kb or
more that have been cloned in a high-capacity vector. If a pair of endsequences do not fall within a single scaffold at their anticipated positions
relative to each other, then again an error in assembly has occurred.
The feasibility of the whole-genome shotgun method has been demonstrated
by its application to the fruit-fly and human genomes. But questions still
remain about the veracity of genome sequences produced by this method.
Comparisons between the two versions of the human genome (Section 4.3)
have shown that the sequence generated by the whole-genome shotgun
method contains a substantial number of missing segments, totaling 160 Mb,
these segments having been lost from the sequence because of the problems
caused by repetitive DNA. These errors have resulted in 36 genes being completely deleted, and a further 67 partially deleted. It has also been suggested
that a sequence obtained by the whole-genome shotgun method might not
have the desired degree of accuracy, even in the regions that have been
assembled correctly. Part of the problem is that the random nature of
sequence generation means that some parts of the genome are covered by

Figure 4.18 The random nature of
sequence generation by the wholegenome shotgun approach means that
some parts of the genome are covered
by more minisequences than other parts.

several of the minisequences that are obtained, whereas other parts are represented just once or twice (Figure 4.18). It is generally accepted that every
part of a genome should be sequenced at least four times to ensure an acceptable level of accuracy, and that this coverage should be increased to 8–10
times before the sequence can be looked upon as being complete. A sequence
obtained by the whole-genome shotgun method is likely to exceed this
requirement in many regions, but may fall short in other areas. If those areas
include genes, then the lack of accuracy could cause major problems when
attempts are made to locate the genes and understand their functions (see
Chapter 5). These problems were highlighted by analysis of the draft
Drosophila sequence produced by the whole-genome shotgun method,
which suggested that as many as 6500 of the 13,600 genes might contain significant sequence errors.

4.3 The Human Genome Projects
To conclude our examination of mapping and sequencing we will look at how
these techniques were applied to the human genome. Although every
genome project is different, with its own challenges and its own solutions to
those challenges, the human projects illustrate the general issues that have
had to be addressed in order to sequence a large eukaryotic genome, and in
many ways illustrate the procedures that are currently regarded as state-ofthe-art in this area of molecular biology.

4.3.1 The mapping phase of the Human Genome Project
Until the beginning of the 1980s, a detailed map of the human genome was
considered to be an unattainable objective. Although comprehensive genetic
maps had been constructed for fruit flies and a few other organisms, the
problems inherent in analysis of human pedigrees (Section 3.2.4) and the relative paucity of polymorphic genetic markers meant that most geneticists
doubted that a human genetic map could ever be achieved. The initial impetus for human genetic mapping came from the discovery of RFLPs, which
were the first highly polymorphic DNA markers to be recognized in animal
genomes. In 1987 the first human RFLP map was published, comprising 393
RFLPs and 10 additional polymorphic markers. This map, developed from
analysis of 21 families, had an average marker density of one per 10 Mb.
In the late 1980s, the Human Genome Project became established as a loose
but organized collaboration between geneticists in all parts of the world. One
of the goals that the Project set itself was a genetic map with a density of one
marker per 1 Mb, although it was thought that a density of one per 2–5 Mb
might be the realistic limit. In fact by 1994 an international consortium had
met and indeed exceeded the objective, thanks to their use of SSLPs and the
large CEPH collection of reference families (Section 3.2.4). The 1994 map contained 5800 markers, of which over 4000 were SSLPs, and had a density of one
marker per 0.7 Mb. A subsequent version took the 1994 map slightly further
by inclusion of an additional 1250 SSLPs.
Physical mapping did not lag far behind. In the early 1990s, considerable
effort was put into the generation of clone contig maps, using STS screening
(Section 3.3.3) as well as other clone fingerprinting methods (Section 4.2.2).
The major achievement of this phase of the physical mapping project was
publication of a clone contig map of the entire genome, consisting of 33,000

YAC clone

Figure 4.19 Some YAC clones contain
segments of DNA from different parts of
the human genome.

YACs containing fragments with an average size of 0.9 Mb. However, doubts
were raised about the value of YAC contig maps when it was realized that YAC
clones can contain two or more pieces of noncontiguous DNA (Figure 4.19).
The use of these chimeric clones in the construction of contig maps could
result in DNA segments that are widely separated in the genome being mistakenly mapped to adjacent positions. These problems led to the adoption of
radiation hybrid mapping of STS markers (Section 3.3.3), largely by the
Whitehead Institute/MIT Genome Center in Massachusetts, culminating in
1995 with publication of a human STS map containing 15,086 markers, with an
average density of one per 199 kb. This map was later supplemented with an
additional 20,104 STSs, most of these being ESTs and hence positioning protein-coding genes on the physical map. The resulting map density approached
the target of one marker per 100 kb set as the objective for physical mapping
at the outset of the Human Genome Project.
The combined STS maps included positions for almost 7000 polymorphic
SSLPs that had also been mapped onto the genome by genetic means. As a
result, the physical and genetic maps could be directly compared, and clone
contig maps that included STS data could be anchored onto both maps. The
net result was a comprehensive, integrated map that could be used as the
framework for the DNA sequencing phase of the Human Genome Project.

4.3.2 Sequencing the human genome
The original plan was that the sequencing phase of the Human Genome
Project would be based on YAC libraries, because this type of vector can be
used with DNA fragments longer than can be handled by any other type of
cloning system. This strategy had to be abandoned when it was discovered
that some YAC clones contained noncontiguous fragments of DNA. The
Project therefore turned its attention to BACs (Section 2.2.1). A library of
300,000 BAC clones was generated and these clones mapped onto the genome,
forming a “sequence-ready” map that could be used as the primary foundation for the sequencing phase of the Project, during which the insert from each
BAC would be completely sequenced by the shotgun method.
At about the time when the Human Genome Project was gearing itself up to
move into the sequence-acquisition phase, the whole-genome shotgun
method was first proposed as an alternative to the more laborious clone contig method that had so far been adopted. The possibility that the Human
Genome Project would not in fact provide the first human genome sequence
stimulated the organizers of the Project to bring forward their planned dates
for completion of a working draft. The first draft sequence of an entire human
chromosome (number 22) was published in December 1999, and the draft
sequence of chromosome 21 appeared a few months later. Finally, on June 26,
2000, accompanied by the President of the United States, Francis Collins and
Craig Venter, the leaders of the two projects, jointly announced completion of
their working drafts, which appeared in print eight months later.
It is important to understand that the two genome sequences published in
2001 were drafts, not complete final sequences. For example, the version
obtained by the clone contig method covered just 90% of the genome, the
missing 320 Mb lying predominantly in constitutive heterochromatin
(Section 10.1.2)—regions of chromosomes in which the DNA is very tightly
packaged and which are thought to contain few, if any genes. Within the 90%

Genomes Chapter 4

Page 123

The Human Genome Projects

of the genome that was covered, each part had been sequenced at least four
times, providing an “acceptable” level of accuracy, but only 25% had been
sequenced the 8 to 10 times that is necessary before the work is considered to
be “finished”. Furthermore, this draft sequence had approximately 150,000
gaps, and it was recognized that some segments had probably not been
ordered correctly. The International Human Genome Sequencing
Consortium, which managed the final phase of the project, set as its goal a
finished sequence of at least 95% of the euchromatin—the part of the
genome in which most of the genes are located—with an error rate of less
than one in 104 nucleotides, and all except the most refractory gaps filled.
Achieving this goal required further sequencing of 46,000 BAC, PAC, YAC, fosmid, and cosmid clones (Section 2.2.1). The first finished chromosome
sequences began to appear in 2004, with the entire genome sequence being
considered complete a year later. This sequence has a total length of 2850 Mb
and lacks just 28 Mb of euchromatin, the latter present in 308 gaps that have
so far resisted all attempts at closure.

4.3.3 The future of the human genome projects
Completion of a finished sequence is not the only goal of the consortia working on the human genome. Understanding the genome sequence is a massive
task that is engaging many groups around the world, making use of various
techniques and approaches which will be described in the next two chapters.
Important among these is the use of comparative genomics, in which two
complete genome sequences are compared in order to identify common features that, being conserved, are likely to be important (see Section 5.1.1).
With the human genome, comparative genomics has the added value that it
may allow the animal versions of human disease genes to be located, paving
the way for studies of the genetic basis of these diseases using the animal
genes as models for the human condition. Drafts of the mouse and rat
genomes were published in 2002, and the chimpanzee draft was completed
in 2005. There will also be additional human genome projects aimed at building up a catalog of sequence variability in different populations, the results
possibly enabling the ancient origins of these populations to be inferred
(Section 19.3.2).
These human diversity projects lead us to the controversial aspects of genome
sequencing. Most scientists anticipate that sequence data from different populations will emphasize the unity of the human race, by showing that patterns
of genetic variability do not reflect the geographic and political groupings that
humans have adopted during the last few centuries. But the outcomes of these
projects are still certain to stimulate debate in nonscientific circles. Additional
controversies center on the question of who, if anyone, will own human DNA
sequences. To many, the idea of ownership of a DNA sequence is a peculiar
concept, but large sums of money can be made from the information contained in the human genome, for example by using gene sequences to direct
development of new drugs and therapies against cancer and other diseases.
Pharmaceutical companies involved in genome sequencing naturally want to
protect their investments, as they would for any other research enterprise, and
currently the only way of doing this is by patenting the DNA sequences that
they discover. Unfortunately, in the past, errors have been made in dealing
with the financial issues relating to research with human biological material,
the individual from whom the material is obtained not always being a party in
the profit sharing. These issues have still to be resolved.

Chapter 4 Sequencing Genomes

The problems relating to the public usage of human genome sequences are
even more contentious. A major concern is the possibility that, once the
sequence is understood, individuals whose sequences are considered “substandard,” for whatever reason, might be discriminated against. The dangers
range from increased insurance premiums for individuals whose sequences
include mutations predisposing them to a genetic disease, to the possibility
that racists might attempt to define “good” and “bad” sequence features, with
depressingly predictable implications for the individuals unlucky enough to
fall into the “bad” category.
The two human genome projects, especially in the United States, continue to
support research and debate into the ethical, legal, and social issues raised by
genome sequencing. In particular, great care is being taken to ensure that the
genome sequences that result from the projects cannot be identified with
any single individual. The DNA that is being cloned and sequenced is taken
only from individuals who have given consent for their material to be used in
this way and for whom anonymity can be guaranteed. When this policy was
first adopted it required a certain amount of realignment of the research
effort because older clone libraries had to be destroyed and the existing
physical maps checked with the new material. It was accepted, however, that
the extra work was necessary to maintain and enhance public confidence in
the projects.

Summary
Procedures for rapid DNA sequencing were first invented in the 1970s. The
version that is most frequently used today is the chain termination method,
which has become popular because it is easy to automate, enabling a large
number of individual experiments to be carried out in a short period of time.
This is important because a single experiment gives only 750 bp or less of
sequence, so thousands if not millions of individual experiments must be carried out in order to obtain the sequence of an entire genome. Other methods
for DNA sequencing, such as the chemical degradation technique and
pyrosequencing, have more specialized roles. When a genome is being
sequenced the major challenge is assembling all the minisequences,
obtained from the multiple sequencing experiments, in the correct order.
With a small bacterial genome, sequence assembly is possible by the shotgun
method, which simply involves examining the minisequences for overlaps.
This approach, which does not need any prior knowledge of the genome, was
first used in 1995 for the 1830 kb genome of Haemophilus influenzae, and has
subsequently become the standard method for sequencing bacterial
genomes. Attempts to apply this approach to larger eukaryotic genomes are
complicated by the presence of repetitive DNA sequences, which can lead to
segments of the genome being assembled incorrectly. The clone contig
approach avoids these problems by identifying a series of clones, in a highcapacity vector such as a BAC, that contain overlapping fragments that have
been anchored onto a physical and/or genetic map of the genome under
study. Short clone contigs can be built up by chromosome walking, but the
longer contigs used in sequencing projects are usually assembled by various
clone fingerprinting techniques. The fragments present in individual clones
are then sequenced by the shotgun method. This is the approach taken by the
official Human Genome Project, but as that project neared the end of the
sequencing phase, Craig Venter and colleagues showed that human and other

Genomes Chapter 4

Summary

larger genomes could be sequenced much more rapidly by the wholegenome shotgun method, which takes the same approach as the standard
shotgun method but includes several safeguards, such as close attention to a
physical map, to ensure that sequences adjacent to repetitive DNA regions
are assembled correctly. Comparison of the two draft human sequences has
suggested that the clone contig method provides a more accurate sequence,
but that the whole-genome shotgun method, because it is rapid, is the best
means of obtaining an initial draft of a genome. The human genome projects
have now progressed to the stage where finished chromosome sequences
have been published, these covering at least 95% of the euchromatin of each
chromosome, with an error rate of less than one in 104 nucleotides. The ethical, legal, and social issues raised by completion of the human sequence
include questions regarding ownership and patent rights, and the possibility
of genetic discrimination.

When you have read Chapter 5, you should be able to:
Describe the strengths and weaknesses of the computational and experimental methods used to
analyze genome sequences.
Describe the basis of open reading frame (ORF) scanning, and explain why this approach is not
always successful in locating genes in eukaryotic genomes.
Explain how genes for functional RNA are located in a genome sequence.
Define the term “homology” and explain how homology and comparative genomics are used to
locate genes in a genome sequence.
Outline the various experimental methods used to identify parts of a genome sequence that
specify RNA molecules.
Evaluate the strengths and limitations of homology analysis as a means of assigning functions
to genes.
Describe the methods used to inactivate or overexpress individual genes in yeast and mammals,
and explain how these methods can lead to identification of the function of a gene.
Give outline descriptions of techniques that can be used to obtain more detailed information on
the activity of a protein coded by an unknown gene.
Summarize the methods used, and progress made, in annotation of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae
genome sequence.

A genome sequence is not an end in itself. A major challenge still has to be
met in understanding what the genome contains and how the genome is
expressed. Attempts at understanding what a genome contains make use of a
combination of computer analysis and experimentation, with the primary
aims of locating the genes and determining their functions. This chapter is
devoted to the methods used to address these questions. The second problem—understanding how the genome is expressed—is, to a certain extent,
merely a different way of stating the objectives of molecular biology over the
last 30 years. The difference is that, in the past, attention has been directed at

the expression pathways for individual genes, with groups of genes being
considered only when the expression of one gene is clearly linked to that of
another. Now the question has become more general and relates to the
expression of the genome as a whole. The techniques used to address this
topic will be covered in Chapter 6.

5.1 Locating the Genes in a Genome Sequence
Once a DNA sequence has been obtained, whether it is the sequence of a single cloned fragment or of an entire chromosome, then various methods can
be employed to locate the genes that are present. These methods can be
divided into those that involve simply inspecting the sequence, by eye or
more frequently by computer, to look for the special sequence features associated with genes, and those methods that locate genes by experimental
analysis of the DNA sequence. The computer methods form part of the
methodology called bioinformatics, and it is with these that we begin.

5.1.1 Gene location by sequence inspection
Sequence inspection can be used to locate genes because genes are not random series of nucleotides but instead have distinctive features. At present we
do not fully understand the nature of all of these specific features, and
sequence inspection is therefore not a foolproof way of locating genes, but it
is still a powerful tool and is usually the first method that is applied to analysis of a new genome sequence.

Figure 5.2 A double-stranded DNA
molecule has six reading frames. Both
strands are read in the 5¢Æ3¢direction. Each
strand has three reading frames, depending
on which nucleotide is chosen as the
starting position.

Genes that code for proteins comprise open reading frames (ORFs) consisting of a series of codons that specify the amino acid sequence of the protein
that the gene codes for (Figure 5.1). The ORF begins with an initiation
codon—usually (but not always) ATG—and ends with a termination codon:
TAA, TAG, or TGA (Section 1.3.2). Searching a DNA sequence for ORFs that
begin with an ATG and end with a termination triplet is therefore one way of
looking for genes. The analysis is complicated by the fact that each DNA
sequence has six reading frames, three in one direction and three in the
reverse direction on the complementary strand (Figure 5.2), but computers
are quite capable of scanning all six reading frames for ORFs. How effective is
this as a means of gene location?
The key to the success of ORF scanning is the frequency with which termination codons appear in the DNA sequence. If the DNA has a random sequence
and a GC content of 50% then each of the three termination codons —TAA,
TAG, and TGA—will appear, on average, once every 43 = 64 bp. If the GC content is greater than 50% then the termination codons, being AT–rich, will
occur less frequently, but one will still be expected every 100–200 bp. This
means that random DNA should not show many ORFs longer than 50 codons
in length, especially if the presence of a starting ATG triplet is used as part of
the definition of an ORF. Most genes, on the other hand, are longer than 50
codons: the average lengths are 317 codons for Escherichia coli, 483 codons
for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and approximately 450 codons for humans.
ORF scanning, in its simplest form, therefore takes a figure of, say, 100 codons
as the shortest length of a putative gene and records positive hits for all ORFs
longer than this.

How well does this strategy work in practice? With bacterial genomes, simple
ORF scanning is an effective way of locating most of the genes in a DNA
sequence. This is illustrated by Figure 5.3, which shows a segment of the E.
coli genome with all ORFs longer than 50 codons highlighted. The real genes
in the sequence cannot be mistaken because they are much longer than 50
codons in length. With bacteria the analysis is further simplified by the fact
that the genes are very closely spaced and hence there is relatively little intergenic DNA in the genome (only 11% for E. coli; see Section 8.2.1). If we
assume that the real genes do not overlap, which is true for most bacterial
genes, then it is only in the intergenic regions that there is a possibility of mistaking a short, spurious ORF for a real gene. So if the intergenic component
of a genome is small, then there is a reduced chance of making mistakes in
interpreting the results of a simple ORF scan.

Simple ORF scans are less effective with DNA of higher eukaryotes
Although ORF scans work well for bacterial genomes, they are less effective
for locating genes in DNA sequences from higher eukaryotes. This is partly
because there is substantially more space between the real genes in a eukaryotic genome (for example, approximately 62% of the human genome is intergenic), increasing the chances of finding spurious ORFs. But the main problem with the human genome and the genomes of higher eukaryotes in general is that their genes are often split by introns (Section 1.2.3), and so do not
appear as continuous ORFs in the DNA sequence. Many exons are shorter
than 100 codons, some consisting of fewer than 50 codons, and continuing
the reading frame into an intron usually leads to a termination sequence that

Figure 5.3 ORF scanning is an effective
way of locating genes in a bacterial
genome. The diagram shows 4522 bp of
the lactose operon of Escherichia coli with
all ORFs longer than 50 codons marked.
The sequence contains two real genes—lacZ
and lacY—indicated by the red lines. These
real genes cannot be mistaken because
they are much longer than the spurious
ORFs, shown in yellow. See Figure 8.8A for
the detailed structure of the lactose operon.

Figure 5.4 ORF scans are complicated by
introns. The nucleotide sequence of a short
gene containing a single intron is shown.
The correct amino acid sequence of the
protein translated from the gene is given
immediately below the nucleotide
sequence: in this sequence, the intron has
been left out because it is removed from
the transcript before the mRNA is translated
into protein. In the lower line, the sequence
has been translated without realizing that an
intron is present. As a result of this error, the
amino acid sequence appears to terminate
within the intron. The amino acid
sequences have been written using the
one-letter abbreviations (see Table 1.2).
Asterisks indicate the positions of
termination codons. Introns are covered in
detail in Section 12.2.2.

appears to close the ORF (Figure 5.4). In other words, the genes of a higher
eukaryote do not appear in the genome sequence as long ORFs, and simple
ORF scanning cannot locate them.
Solving the problem posed by introns is the main challenge for bioinformaticists writing new software programs for ORF location. Three modifications to
the basic procedure for ORF scanning have been adopted:
G

Codon bias is taken into account. “Codon bias” refers to the fact that not
all codons are used equally frequently in the genes of a particular organism. For example, leucine is specified by six codons in the genetic code
(TTA, TTG, CTT, CTC, CTA, and CTG; see Figure 1.20), but in human genes
leucine is most frequently coded by CTG and is only rarely specified by
TTA or CTA. Similarly, of the four valine codons, human genes use GTG
four times more frequently than GTA. The biological reason for codon bias
is not understood, but all organisms have a bias, which is different in different species. Real exons are expected to display the codon bias whereas
chance series of triplets do not. The codon bias of the organism being
studied is therefore written into the ORF-scanning software.

G

Exon–intron boundaries can be searched for as these have distinctive
sequence features, although unfortunately the distinctiveness of these
sequences is not so great as to make their location a trivial task. The
sequence of the upstream exon–intron boundary is usually described as:
5¢–AGØGTAAGT–3¢
the arrow indicating the precise boundary point. However, only the “GT”
immediately after the arrow is invariable: elsewhere in the sequence,
nucleotides other than the ones shown are quite often found. In other words,
the sequence is a consensus, by which we mean that the sequence shows the
most frequent nucleotide at each position in all of the upstream exon–intron
boundaries that are known, but that in any particular boundary sequence
one or more of these positions might have a different nucleotide (Figure
5.5). The downstream intron–exon boundary is even less well defined:
5¢–PyPyPyPyPyPyNCAGØ–3¢
where “Py” means one of the pyrimidine nucleotides (T or C) and “N” is
any nucleotide. Simply searching for these consensus sequences will not
locate more than a few exon–intron boundaries because most have
sequences other than the ones shown. Writing software that takes account
of the known variables has proven difficult, and at present locating
exon–intron boundaries by sequence analysis is a hit-and-miss affair.

G

Upstream regulatory sequences can be used to locate the regions where
genes begin. This is because these regulatory sequences, like exon–intron
boundaries, have distinctive sequence features that they possess in order

Genomes Chapter 5

Locating the Genes in a Genome Sequence

to carry out their role as recognition signals for the DNA-binding proteins
involved in gene expression (Chapter 11). Unfortunately, as with
exon–intron boundaries, the regulatory sequences are variable, more so in
eukaryotes than in prokaryotes, and in eukaryotes not all genes have the
same collection of regulatory sequences. Using these to locate genes is
therefore problematic.
These three extensions of simple ORF scanning, despite their limitations, are
generally applicable to the genomes of all higher eukaryotes. Additional
strategies are also possible with individual organisms, based on the special
features of their genomes. For example, vertebrate genomes contain CpG
islands upstream of many genes, these being sequences of approximately 1
kb in which the GC content is greater than the average for the genome as a
whole. Some 40%–50% of human genes are associated with an upstream CpG
island. These sequences are distinctive and when one is located in vertebrate
DNA, a strong assumption can be made that a gene begins in the region
immediately downstream.

ORF scanning is appropriate for protein-coding genes, but what about those
genes for functional RNAs such as rRNA and tRNA (Section 1.2.2)? These
genes do not comprise open reading frames and hence will not be located by
the methods described above. Functional RNA molecules do, however, have
their own distinctive features, which can be used to aid their discovery in a
genome sequence. The most important of these features is the ability to fold

into a secondary structure, such as the cloverleaf adopted by tRNA molecules
(Figure 5.6A). These secondary structures are held together by base pairing
not between two separate polynucleotides, as in the DNA double helix, but
between different parts of the same polynucleotide—what we call intramolecular base pairing. In order for intramolecular base pairs to form, the
nucleotide sequences in the two parts of the molecule must be complementary, and to produce a complex structure such as the cloverleaf, the components of these pairs of complementary sequences must be arranged in a characteristic order within the RNA sequence (Figure 5.6B). These features provide a wealth of information that can be used to locate tRNA genes in a
genome sequence, and programs designed for this specific purpose are usually very successful.
As well as tRNAs, rRNAs and some of the small functional RNAs (Section
1.2.2) also adopt secondary structures that have sufficient complexity to
enable their genes to be identified without too much difficulty. Other functional RNA genes are less easy to locate because the RNAs take up structures
that involve relatively little base pairing or the base pairing is not in a regular pattern. Three approaches are being used for location of the genes for
these RNAs:
G

Although some functional RNAs do not adopt complex secondary structures, most contain one or more stem-loops (or hairpins), which result
from the simplest type of intramolecular base pairing (Figure 5.7).
Programs that scan DNA sequences for such structures therefore identify
regions where functional RNA genes might be present. These programs
incorporate thermodynamic rules that enable the stability of a stem-loop
to be estimated, taking into account features such as the size of the loop,
the number of base pairs in the stem, and the proportion of G–C base
pairs (these being more stable than A–T pairs as they are held together by
three rather than two hydrogen bonds; see Figure 1.8). A putative stemloop structure with an estimated stability above a chosen limit is considered a possible indicator of the presence of a functional RNA gene.

G

As with protein-coding genes, a search can be made for regulatory
sequences associated with genes for functional RNAs. These regulatory
sequences are different to those for protein-coding genes, and may be
present within a functional RNA gene as well as upstream of it.

G

In compact genomes, attention is directed toward regions that remain
after a comprehensive search for protein-coding genes. Often these
“empty spaces” are not empty at all and a careful examination will reveal
the presence of one or more functional RNA genes.

Homology searches and comparative genomics give an extra
dimension to sequence inspection
Most of the various software programs available for gene location by ORF
scanning can identify up to 95% of the coding regions in a eukaryotic
genome, but even the best ones tend to make frequent mistakes in their positioning of the exon–intron boundaries, and identification of spurious ORFs as
real genes is still a major problem. These limitations can be offset to a certain
extent by the use of a homology search to test whether a series of triplets is a
real exon or a chance sequence. In this analysis the DNA databases are
searched to determine if the test sequence is identical or similar to any genes
that have already been sequenced. Obviously if the test sequence is part of a

Genomes Chapter 5

139

gene that has already been sequenced by someone else then an identical
match will be found, but this is not the point of a homology search. Instead
the intention is to determine if an entirely new sequence is similar to any
known genes because, if it is, then there is a chance that the test and match
sequences are homologous, meaning that they represent genes that are evolutionarily related. The main use of homology searching is to assign functions
to newly discovered genes, and we will therefore return to it when we deal
with this aspect of genome analysis later in the chapter (Section 5.2.1). The
technique is also central to gene location because it enables tentative exon
sequences located by ORF scanning to be tested for functionality. If the tentative exon sequence gives one or more positive matches after a homology
search then it is probably a real exon, but if it gives no match then its authenticity must remain in doubt until it is assessed by one or other of the experiment-based gene location techniques.
A more precise version of homology searching is possible when genome
sequences are available for two or more related species. Related species have
genomes that share similarities inherited from their common ancestor, overlaid with species-specific differences that have arisen since the species began
to evolve independently (Figure 5.8). Because of natural selection (Section
19.3.2), the sequence similarities between related genomes are greatest
within the genes and lowest in the intergenic regions. Therefore, when related
genomes are compared, homologous genes are easily identified because they
have high sequence similarity, and any ORF that does not have a clear
homolog in the second genome can be discounted as almost certainly being
a chance sequence and not a genuine gene. This type of analysis—called
comparative genomics—is proving very valuable for locating genes in the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome (Section 5.3), as complete or partial
sequences are now available not only for this yeast but also for 16 other members of the Hemiascomycetes, including Saccharomyces paradoxus,
Saccharomyces mikatae, and Saccharomyces bayanus, the species most
closely related to S. cerevisiae. Comparisons between these genomes have
confirmed the authenticity of a number of S. cerevisiae ORFs, and also
enabled almost 500 putative ORFs to be removed from the S. cerevisiae catalog on the grounds that they have no equivalents in the related genomes. The

Short ORF

analysis is made even more powerful by the synteny—conservation of gene
order—displayed by the genomes of these related yeasts. Although each
genome has undergone its own species-specific rearrangements there are still
substantial regions where the gene order in the S. cerevisiae genome is the
same as in one or more of the related genomes. This makes it very easy to
identify homologous genes but, more importantly, enables a spurious ORF,
especially a short one, to be discarded with great confidence, because its
expected location in a related genome can be searched in detail to ensure that
no equivalent is present (Figure 5.9).

Automatic annotation of genome sequences
One great advantage of computer-based approaches to gene location is the
possibility of combining a set of analytical programs into a single, integrated
system. In this way, different approaches to gene location can be carried out
in parallel, and the results automatically compared so that the genome under
study is quickly and comprehensively annotated. Genome annotation using
these systems begins with sequence analysis using programs that scan for
ORFs, exon–intron boundaries, and upstream regulatory sequences, test the
ORFs for homology to genes in the databases, and search for repeat
sequences and for the characteristic features of the genes for functional RNAs.
Databases of cDNA sequences (see below) might also be scanned for any that
match segments of the genome sequence, any such matches indicating a

region that is transcribed into mRNA. The information is then integrated into
a computer display that shows the locations of the various sequence features
as determined by the different programs (Figure 5.10). The resulting information can often be accessed over the internet and hence used by other
researchers to plan their own, more detailed computational or experimental
studies of specific regions of a genome.

5.1.2 Experimental techniques for gene location
Most experimental methods for gene location are not based on direct examination of DNA molecules but instead rely on detection of the RNA molecules
that are transcribed from genes. All genes are transcribed into RNA, and if the
gene is discontinuous then the primary transcript is subsequently processed
to remove the introns and link up the exons (Sections 1.2.3 and 12.2.2).
Techniques that map the positions of transcribed sequences in a DNA fragment can therefore be used to locate exons and entire genes. The only problem to be kept in mind is that the transcript is usually longer than the coding
part of the gene because it begins several tens of nucleotides upstream of the
initiation codon and continues several tens or hundreds of nucleotides
downstream of the termination codon. Transcript analysis does not, therefore, give a precise definition of the start and end of the coding region of a
gene, but it does tell you that a gene is present in a particular region and it can
locate the exon–intron boundaries. Often this is sufficient information to
enable the coding region to be delineated.

Hybridization tests can determine if a fragment contains transcribed
sequences
The simplest procedures for studying transcribed sequences are based on
hybridization analysis. RNA molecules can be separated by specialized forms
of agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane, and examined by the process called northern hybridization (see
Technical Note 5.1). This differs from Southern hybridization (Section 2.1.2)
only in the precise conditions under which the transfer is carried out, and the
fact that it was not invented by a Dr Northern and so does not have a capital
“N.” If a northern blot of cellular RNA is probed with a labeled fragment of the
genome, then RNAs transcribed from genes within that fragment will be
detected (Figure 5.11). Northern hybridization is therefore, theoretically, a
means of determining the number of genes present in a DNA fragment and
the size of each coding region. There are two weaknesses with this approach:
G

Some individual genes give rise to two or more transcripts of different
lengths because some of their exons are optional and may or may not be
retained in the mature RNA (Section 12.2.2). If this is the case, then a fragment that contains just one gene could detect two or more hybridizing
bands in the northern blot. A similar problem can occur if the gene is a
member of a multigene family (Section 7.2.3).

G

With many species, it is not practical to make an mRNA preparation from
an entire organism so the extract is obtained from a single organ or tissue.
Consequently any genes not expressed in that organ or tissue will not be
represented in the RNA population, and so will not be detected when the
RNA is probed with the DNA fragment being studied. Even if the whole
organism is used, not all genes will give hybridization signals because
many are expressed only at a particular developmental stage, and others
are weakly expressed, meaning that their RNA products are present in
amounts too low to be detected by hybridization analysis.

two largest rRNA molecules (Section 1.2.2),
which are abundant in most cells. The
smaller rRNAs, which are also abundant, are
not seen because they are so short that
they run out the bottom of the gel and, in
most cells, none of the mRNAs are
abundant enough to form a band visible
after ethidium bromide staining. The gel is
blotted onto a nylon membrane and, in this
example, probed with a radioactively labeled
DNA fragment. A single band is visible on
the autoradiograph, showing that the DNA
fragment used as the probe contains part or
all of one transcribed sequence.

Chapter 5 Understanding a Genome Sequence

Technical Note 5.1 Techniques for studying RNA
Many of the techniques devised for studying DNA molecules can be adapted for use with RNA
Agarose gel electrophoresis of RNA is carried out after
denaturation of the RNA so that the migration rate of each
molecule is dependent entirely on its length, and is not
influenced by the intramolecular base pairs that can form in
many RNAs (e.g., Figure 13.2). The denaturant, usually
formaldehyde or glyoxal, is added to the sample before it is
loaded onto the gel.
Northern hybridization refers to the procedure whereby
an RNA gel is blotted onto a nylon membrane and
hybridized to a labeled probe (see Figure 5.11). This is
equivalent to Southern hybridization (see Figure 2.11) and
is done in a similar way.
Labeled RNA molecules are usually prepared by copying
a DNA template into RNA in the presence of a labeled
ribonucleotide. The RNA polymerase enzymes of SP6, T3,
or T7 bacteriophages are used because they can produce
up to 30 mg of labeled RNA from 1 mg of DNA in 30 minutes. RNA can also be end-labeled by treatment with purified poly(A) polymerase (Section 12.2.1).
PCR of RNA molecules requires a modification to the first
step of the normal reaction. Taq polymerase cannot copy
an RNA molecule, so the first step is catalyzed by a reverse
transcriptase, which makes a DNA copy of the RNA template. This DNA copy is then amplified by Taq polymerase.
The technique is called reverse transcriptase-PCR, or
RT-PCR. The discovery of thermostable enzymes that make
DNA copies of both RNA and DNA templates (e.g., the Tth
DNA polymerase from the bacterium Thermus ther-

mophilus) raises the possibility of carrying out RT-PCR in a
single reaction with just one enzyme.
RNA sequencing methods exist but are difficult to perform and are applicable only to small molecules. The
methods are similar to chemical degradation sequencing
of DNA (Section 4.1.2) but employ sequence-specific
endonucleases rather than chemicals to generate the
cleaved molecules. In practice, the sequence of an RNA
molecule is usually obtained by converting it into cDNA
(see Figure 3.36) and sequencing by the chain termination method (Section 4.1.1).
Specialist methods have been developed for mapping the
positions of RNA molecules on to DNA sequences, for
example to determine the start and end points of transcription and to locate the positions of introns in a DNA
sequence. These methods are described in Section 5.1.2.
The only major deficiency in the RNA toolkit is the absence
of enzymes with the degree of sequence specificity displayed by the restriction endonucleases that are so important in DNA manipulations. Other than this, the only drawback with RNA work is the ease with which RNAs are
degraded by ribonucleases that are released when cells are
disrupted (as occurs during RNA extraction), and which are
also present on the hands of laboratory workers and which
tend to contaminate glassware and solutions. This means
that rigorous laboratory procedures (e.g., cleaning of glassware with chemicals that destroy ribonucleases) have to be
adopted in order to keep RNA molecules intact.

A second type of hybridization analysis avoids the problems with poorly
expressed and tissue-specific genes by searching not for RNAs but for related
sequences in the DNAs of other organisms. This approach, like homology
searching, is based on the fact that homologous genes in related organisms
have similar sequences, whereas the intergenic DNA is usually quite different.
If a DNA fragment from one species is used to probe a Southern transfer of
DNAs from related species, and one or more hybridization signals are
obtained, then it is likely that the probe contains one or more genes (Figure
5.12). This is called zoo-blotting.

cDNA sequencing enables genes to be mapped within DNA
fragments
Northern hybridization and zoo-blotting enable the presence or absence of
genes in a DNA fragment to be determined, but give no positional information
relating to the location of those genes in the DNA sequence. The easiest way to

Genomes Chapter 5

obtain this information is to sequence the relevant cDNAs. A cDNA is a copy
of an mRNA (see Figure 3.36) and so corresponds to the coding region of a
gene, plus any leader or trailer sequences that are also transcribed. Comparing
a cDNA sequence with a genomic DNA sequence therefore delineates the
position of the relevant gene and reveals the exon–intron boundaries.
Human

In order to obtain an individual cDNA, a cDNA library must first be prepared
from all of the mRNA in the tissue being studied. Once the library has been
prepared, the success of cDNA sequencing as a means of gene location
depends on two factors. The first concerns the frequency of the desired
cDNAs in the library. As with northern hybridization, the problem relates to
the different expression levels of different genes. If the DNA fragment being
studied contains one or more poorly expressed genes, then the relevant
cDNAs will be rare in the library and it might be necessary to screen many
clones before the desired one is identified. To get around this problem, various methods of cDNA capture or cDNA selection have been devised, in
which the DNA fragment being studied is repeatedly hybridized to the pool
of cDNAs in order to enrich the pool for the desired clones. Because the
cDNA pool contains so many different sequences, it is generally not possible
to discard all the irrelevant clones by these repeated hybridizations, but it is
possible to increase significantly the frequency of those clones that specifically hybridize to the DNA fragment. This reduces the size of the library that
must subsequently be screened under stringent conditions to identify the
desired clones.
A second factor that determines success or failure is the completeness of the
individual cDNA molecules. Usually, cDNAs are made by copying RNA molecules into single-stranded DNA with reverse transcriptase and then converting the single-stranded DNA into double-stranded DNA with a DNA
polymerase (see Figure 3.36). There is always a chance that one or other of
the strand synthesis reactions will not proceed to completion, resulting in a
truncated cDNA. The presence of intramolecular base pairs in the RNA can
also lead to incomplete copying. Truncated cDNAs may lack some of the
information needed to locate the start and end points of a gene and all its
exon–intron boundaries.

Methods are available for precise mapping of the ends of transcripts
The problems with incomplete cDNAs mean that more robust methods are
needed for locating the precise start and end points of gene transcripts. One
possibility is a special type of PCR that uses RNA rather than DNA as the starting material. The first step in this type of PCR is to convert the RNA into cDNA
with reverse transcriptase, after which the cDNA is amplified with Taq polymerase in the same way as in a normal PCR. These methods go under the collective name of reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) but the particular version that interests us at present is rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE).
In the simplest form of this method, one of the primers is specific for an internal region close to the beginning of the gene being studied. This primer
attaches to the mRNA for the gene and directs the first reverse
transcriptase–catalyzed stage of the process, during which a cDNA corresponding to the start of the mRNA is made (Figure 5.13). Because only a small
segment of the mRNA is being copied, the expectation is that the cDNA synthesis will not terminate prematurely, so one end of the cDNA will correspond
exactly with the start of the mRNA. Once the cDNA has been made, a short

to determine if a fragment of human DNA
hybridizes to DNAs from related species.
Samples of human, chimpanzee, cow, and
rabbit DNAs are therefore prepared,
restricted, and electrophoresed in an agarose
gel. Southern hybridization is then carried
out with a human DNA fragment as the
probe. A positive hybridization signal is seen
with each of the animal DNAs, suggesting
that the human DNA fragment contains an
expressed gene. Note that the hybridizing
restriction fragments from the cow and
rabbit DNAs are smaller than the hybridizing
fragments in the human and chimpanzee
samples. This indicates that the restriction
map around the transcribed sequence is
different in cows and rabbits, but does not
affect the conclusion that a homologous
gene is present in all four species.

poly(A) tail is attached to its 3¢ end. The second primer anneals to this poly(A)
sequence and, during the first round of the normal PCR, converts the singlestranded cDNA into a double-stranded molecule, which is subsequently
amplified as the PCR proceeds. The sequence of this amplified molecule will
reveal the precise position of the start of the transcript.
Other methods for precise transcript mapping involve heteroduplex analysis.
If the DNA region being studied is cloned as a restriction fragment in an M13
vector (Section 4.1.1) then it can be obtained as single-stranded DNA. When
mixed with an appropriate RNA preparation, the transcribed sequence in the
cloned DNA hybridizes with the equivalent mRNA, forming a double-stranded
heteroduplex. In the example shown in Figure 5.14, the start of this mRNA lies
within the cloned restriction fragment, so some of the cloned fragment participates in the heteroduplex, but the rest does not. The single-stranded regions
can be digested by treatment with a single-strand-specific nuclease such as S1.
The size of the heteroduplex is determined by degrading the RNA component
with alkali and electrophoresing the resulting single-stranded DNA in an
agarose gel. This size measurement is then used to position the start of the
transcript relative to the restriction site at the end of the cloned fragment.

Exon–intron boundaries can also be located with precision
Heteroduplex analysis can also be used to locate exon–intron boundaries.
The method is almost the same as that shown in Figure 5.14 with the exception that the cloned restriction fragment spans the exon–intron boundary
being mapped rather than the start of the transcript.

Figure 5.13 RACE—rapid amplification of
cDNA ends. The RNA being studied is
converted into a partial cDNA by extension
of a DNA primer that anneals at an internal
position not too distant from the 5¢ end of
the molecule. The 3¢ end of the cDNA is
further extended by treatment with terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Section 2.1.4)
in the presence of dATP, which results in a
series of As being added to the cDNA. This
series of As acts as the annealing site for
the anchor primer. Extension of the anchor
primer leads to a double-stranded DNA
molecule, which can now be amplified by a
standard PCR. This is 5¢-RACE, so-called
because it results in amplification of the 5¢
end of the starting RNA. A similar method—
3¢-RACE—can be used if the 3¢ endsequence is desired.

A second method for finding exons in a genome sequence is called exon trapping. This requires a special type of vector that contains a minigene consisting
of two exons flanking an intron sequence, the first exon being preceded by the
sequence signals needed to initiate transcription in a eukaryotic cell (Figure
5.15). To use the vector, the piece of DNA to be studied is inserted into a restriction site located within the vector’s intron region. The vector is then introduced
into a suitable eukaryotic cell line, where it is transcribed and the RNA produced from it is spliced. The result is that any exon contained in the genomic
fragment becomes attached between the upstream and downstream exons
from the minigene. RT-PCR with primers annealing within the two minigene
exons is now used to amplify a DNA fragment, which is sequenced. As the minigene sequence is already known, the nucleotide positions at which the inserted
exon starts and ends can be determined, precisely delineating this exon.

5.2 Determining the Functions of Individual Genes
Once a new gene has been located in a genome sequence, the question of its
function has to be addressed. This is turning out to be an important area of
genomics research, because completed sequencing projects have revealed
that we know rather less than we thought about the content of individual
genomes. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, were
studied intensively by conventional genetic analysis before the advent of
sequencing projects, and geneticists were at one time fairly confident that
most of their genes had been identified. The genome sequences revealed that
in fact there are large gaps in our knowledge. Of the 4288 protein-coding
genes in the E. coli genome sequence, only 1853 (43% of the total) had been
previously identified. For S. cerevisiae the figure was only 30%.

Determining the Functions of Individual Genes

As with gene location, attempts to determine the functions of unknown genes
are made by computer analysis and by experimental studies.

5.2.1 Computer analysis of gene function
We have already seen that computer analysis plays an important role in locating genes in DNA sequences, and that one of the most powerful tools available for this purpose is homology searching, which locates genes by comparing the DNA sequence under study with all the other DNA sequences in the
databases. The basis of homology searching is that related genes have similar
sequences and so a new gene can be discovered by virtue of its similarity to
an equivalent, already-sequenced gene from a different organism. Now we
will look more closely at homology analysis and see how it can be used to
assign a function to a new gene.

Homology reflects evolutionary relationships
Homologous genes are ones that share a common evolutionary ancestor,
revealed by sequence similarities between the genes. These similarities form
the data on which molecular phylogenies are based, as we will see in Chapter
19. Homologous genes fall into two categories (Figure 5.16):
G

G

Nuclease S1, degrades all
single-stranded regions
R2

Orthologous genes are those homologs that are present in different
organisms and whose common ancestor predates the split between the
species. Orthologous genes usually have the same, or very similar, functions. For example, the myoglobin genes of humans and chimpanzees are
orthologs.
Paralogous genes are present in the same organism, often as members of
a recognized multigene family (Section 7.2.3), their common ancestor
possibly or possibly not predating the species in which the genes are now
found. For example, the myoglobin and b-globin genes of humans are
paralogs: they originated by duplication of an ancestral gene some 550
million years ago (Section 18.2.1).

A pair of homologous genes do not usually have identical nucleotide
sequences, because the two genes undergo different random changes by
mutation, but they have similar sequences because these random changes
have operated on the same starting sequence, the common ancestral gene.
Homology searching makes use of these sequence similarities. The basis of
the analysis is that if a newly sequenced gene turns out to be similar to a previously sequenced gene, then an evolutionary relationship can be inferred
and the function of the new gene is likely to be the same, or at least similar, to
the function of the known gene.
It is important not to confuse the words homology and similarity. It is incorrect to describe a pair of related genes as “80% homologous” if their sequences
have 80% nucleotide identity (Figure 5.17). A pair of genes are either evolutionarily related or they are not; there are no in-between situations and it is
therefore meaningless to ascribe a percentage value to homology.

Homology analysis can provide information on the function of an
entire gene or of segments within it
A homology search can be conducted with a DNA sequence but usually a
tentative gene sequence is converted into an amino acid sequence before
the search is carried out. One reason for this is that there are 20 different
amino acids in proteins but only four nucleotides in DNA, so genes that are

method of transcript mapping makes use of
nuclease S1, an enzyme that degrades
single-stranded DNA or RNA
polynucleotides, including single-stranded
regions in predominantly double-stranded
molecules, but has no effect on doublestranded DNA or on DNA–RNA hybrids. In
the example shown, a restriction fragment
that spans the start of a transcription unit is
ligated into an M13 vector and the resulting
single-stranded DNA hybridized with an RNA
preparation. After nuclease S1 treatment, the
resulting heteroduplex has one end marked
by the start of the transcript and the other
by the downstream restriction site (R2).
The size of the undigested DNA fragment
is therefore measured by gel
electrophoresis in order to determine the
position of the start of the transcription unit
relative to the downstream restriction site.

A homology search program begins by making alignments between the query
sequence and sequences from the databases. For each alignment, a score is
calculated from which the operator can gauge the likelihood that the query
and test sequences are homologs. There are two ways of generating the score:
G

The simplest programs count the number of positions at which the same
amino acid is present in both sequences. This number, when converted
into a percentage, gives the degree of identity between two sequences.

G

More sophisticated programs use the chemical relatedness between nonidentical amino acids to assign a score to each position in the alignment,
a higher score for identical or closely related amino acids (e.g., leucine and
isoleucine, or aspartic acid and asparagine) and a lower score for lessrelated amino acids (e.g., cysteine and tyrosine, or phenylalanine and serine). This analysis determines the degree of similarity between a pair of
sequences.

vector consists of two exon sequences

containing an unmapped exon is ligated
into the vector and the recombinant
molecule introduced into the host cell. The
resulting RNA transcript is then examined
by RT-PCR to identify the boundaries of the
unmapped exon.

To achieve the highest possible score, the algorithm introduces gaps at various
positions in one or both sequences, up to limits set by the operator, paralleling processes thought to occur during the evolution of genes, when blocks of
nucleotides coding for individual or adjacent amino acids may be inserted
into or deleted from a gene.
The practicalities of homology searching are not at all daunting. Several software programs exist for this type of analysis, the most popular being BLAST
(Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). The analysis can be carried out simply
by logging on to the web site for one of the DNA databases and entering the
sequence into the online search tool. The standard BLAST program is efficient at identifying homologous genes that have more than 30%–40%
sequence similarity, but is less effective at recognizing evolutionary relationships if the similarity is lower than this amount. The modified version called
PSI-BLAST (position-specific iterated BLAST) identifies more distantly
related sequences, by combining the homologous sequences from a standard
BLAST search into a profile, the features of which are used to identify additional homologous sequences that were not detected in the initial search.
Homology searching with BLAST and similar programs has gained immense
importance in genomics research, but its limitations must be recognized. A
growing problem is the presence in the databases of genes whose stated functions are incorrect. If one of these genes is identified as a homolog of the

query sequence, then the incorrect function will be passed on to this new
sequence, adding to the problem. There are also several cases where homologous genes have quite different biological functions, an example being the
crystallins of the eye lens, some of which are homologous to metabolic
enzymes. Homology between a query sequence and a crystallin therefore
does not mean that the query sequence is a crystallin and, similarly, an apparently clear homology between a query sequence and a metabolic enzyme
might not mean that the query sequence is a metabolic enzyme.
There are also examples of genes that have similar sequences but no obvious
evolutionary relatedness. Sometimes the explanation is that, although the
genes are unrelated, their proteins have similar functions and the shared
sequence encodes a domain within each protein that is central to that shared
function. Although the genes themselves have no common ancestor, the
domains do, but with their common ancestor occurring at a very ancient time
and the homologous domains having subsequently evolved not only by single nucleotide changes but also by more complex rearrangements that have
created new genes within which the domains are found (Section 18.2.1).
When recognized, this type of homology can be extremely informative. A typical example is provided by the tudor domain, an approximately 120–amino
acid motif which was first identified in the sequence of the Drosophila
melanogaster gene called tudor. The protein coded by the tudor gene, whose
function is unknown, is made up of ten copies of the tudor domain, one after
the other (Figure 5.19). A homology search using the tudor domain as the test
revealed that several known proteins contain this domain. The sequences of
these proteins are not highly similar to one another and there is no indication
that they are true homologs, but they all possess the tudor domain. These
proteins include one involved in RNA transport during Drosophila oogenesis,
a human protein with a role in RNA metabolism, and others whose activities
appear to involve RNA in one way or another. The homology analysis therefore suggests that the tudor sequence plays some part in the interaction
between the protein and its RNA substrate. The information from the computer analysis is incomplete by itself, but it points the way to the types of
experiment that should be done to obtain more clear-cut data on the
function of the tudor domain.

Using homology searching to assign functions to human
disease genes
To illustrate the importance of homology searching in genomics we will
examine how this technique has aided research into human genetic disease.
One of the main reasons for sequencing the human genome has been to gain
access to genes involved in human disease. The hope is that the sequence of

a disease gene will provide an insight into the biochemical basis of the disease and hence indicate a way of preventing or treating the disease.
Homology searching has an important role to play in the study of disease
genes because the discovery of a homolog of a human disease gene in a second organism is often the key to understanding the biochemical function of
the human gene. If the homolog has already been characterized, then the
information needed to understand the biochemical role of the human gene
may already be in place; if it has not been characterized, then the necessary
research can be directed at the homolog.
It is not necessary for the homolog to be present in a closely related species in
order to be useful in the study of human disease. Drosophila holds great
promise in this respect, as the phenotypic effects of many Drosophila genes
are well known, so the data already exist for inferring the mode of action of
human disease genes that have homologs in the Drosophila genome. But the
greatest success has been with yeast. Several human disease genes have
homologs in the S. cerevisiae genome (Table 5.1). These disease genes include
ones involved in cancer, cystic fibrosis, and neurological syndromes, and in
several cases the yeast homolog has a known function that provides a clear
indication of the biochemical activity of the human gene. In some cases it has
even been possible to demonstrate a physiological similarity between the
gene activity in humans and yeast. For example, the yeast gene SGS1 is a
homolog of a human gene involved in the diseases called Bloom’s and
Werner’s syndromes, which are characterized by growth disorders. Yeasts with
a mutant SGS1 gene live for shorter periods than normal yeasts and display
accelerated onset-of-aging indicators such as sterility. The yeast gene has
been shown to code for one of a pair of related DNA helicases that are
required for transcription of rRNA genes and for DNA replication. The link
between SGS1 and the genes for Bloom’s and Werner’s syndromes, provided
by homology searching, has therefore indicated the possible biochemical
basis of the human diseases.

5.2.2 Assigning gene function by experimental analysis
It is clear that homology analysis is not a panacea that can identify the functions of all new genes. Experimental methods are therefore needed to complement and extend the results of homology studies. This is proving to be one

of the biggest challenges in genomics research, and most molecular biologists
agree that the methodologies and strategies currently in use are not entirely
adequate for assigning functions to the vast numbers of unknown genes
being discovered by sequencing projects. The problem is that the objective—
to plot a course from gene to function—is the reverse of the route normally
taken by genetic analysis, in which the starting point is a phenotype and the
objective is to identify the underlying gene or genes. The problem we are currently addressing takes us in the opposite direction: starting with a new gene
and hopefully leading to identification of the associated phenotype.

Functional analysis by gene inactivation
In conventional genetic analysis, the genetic basis of a phenotype is usually
studied by searching for mutant organisms in which the phenotype has
become altered. The mutants might be obtained experimentally, for example
by treating a population of organisms (e.g., a culture of bacteria) with ultraviolet radiation or a mutagenic chemical (see Section 16.1.1), or the mutants
might be present in a natural population. The gene or genes that have been
altered in the mutant organism are then studied by genetic crosses (Section
3.2.4), which can locate the position of a gene in a genome and also determine if the gene is the same as one that has already been characterized. The
gene can then be studied further by molecular biology techniques such as
cloning and sequencing.
The general principle of this conventional analysis is that the genes responsible for a phenotype can be identified by determining which genes are inactivated in organisms that display a mutant version of the phenotype. If the
starting point is the gene, rather than the phenotype, then the equivalent
strategy would be to mutate the gene and identify the phenotypic change that
results. This is the basis of most of the techniques used to assign functions to
unknown genes.

Individual genes can be inactivated by homologous recombination
The easiest way to inactivate a specific gene is to disrupt it with an unrelated
segment of DNA (Figure 5.20). This can be achieved by homologous recombination between the chromosomal copy of the gene and a second piece of
DNA that shares some sequence identity with the target gene. Homologous
and other types of recombination are complex events, which we will deal with
in detail in Chapter 17. For present purposes it is enough to know that if two
DNA molecules have similar sequences, then recombination can result in
segments of the molecules being exchanged.
How is gene inactivation carried out in practice? We will consider two examples, the first with S. cerevisiae. Since completing the genome sequence in
1996, yeast molecular biologists have embarked on a coordinated, international effort to determine the functions of as many unknown genes as possible (Section 5.3). One technique that is being used is shown in Figure 5.21.
The central component is the “deletion cassette,” which carries a gene for
antibiotic resistance. This gene is not a normal component of the yeast
genome but it will work if transferred into a yeast chromosome, giving rise
to a transformed yeast cell that is resistant to the antibiotic geneticin. Before
using the deletion cassette, new segments of DNA are attached as tails to
either end. These segments have sequences identical to parts of the yeast
gene that is going to be inactivated. After the modified cassette is introduced into a yeast cell, homologous recombination occurs between the

cassette. The deletion cassette consists of
an antibiotic-resistance gene preceded by
the promoter sequences needed for
expression in yeast, and flanked by two
restriction sites. The start and end
segments of the target gene are inserted
into the restriction sites, and the vector is
introduced into yeast cells. Recombination
between the gene segments in the vector
and the chromosomal copy of the target
gene results in disruption of the latter. Cells
in which the disruption has occurred are
identifiable because they now express the
antibiotic-resistance gene and so will grow
on an agar medium containing geneticin.

abbreviation for “kanamycin resistance,”

group of antibiotics that include geneticin.

DNA tails and the chromosomal copy of the yeast gene, replacing the latter
with the antibiotic-resistance gene. Cells which have undergone the
replacement are therefore selected by plating the culture onto agar medium
containing geneticin. The resulting colonies lack the target gene activity and
their phenotypes can be examined to gain some insight into the function of
the gene.
The second example of gene inactivation uses an analogous process but with
mice rather than yeast. The mouse is frequently used as a model organism
for humans because the mouse genome is similar to the human genome,
containing many of the same genes. Functional analysis of unknown human
genes is therefore being carried out largely by inactivating the equivalent
genes in the mouse, these experiments being ethically unthinkable with
humans. The homologous recombination part of the procedure is identical to
that described for yeast, and once again results in a cell in which the target
gene has been inactivated. The problem is that we do not want just one
mutated cell, we want a whole mutant mouse, as only with the complete
organism can we make a full assessment of the effect of the gene inactivation
on the phenotype. To achieve this it is necessary to use a special type of
mouse cell: an embryonic stem or ES cell. Unlike most mouse cells, ES cells
are totipotent, meaning that they are not committed to a single developmental pathway and can therefore give rise to all types of differentiated cell.
The engineered ES cell is therefore injected into a mouse embryo, which
continues to develop and eventually gives rise to a chimera, a mouse whose
cells are a mixture of mutant ones, derived from the engineered ES cells, and
nonmutant ones, derived from all the other cells in the embryo. This is still
not quite what we want, so the chimeric mice are allowed to mate with one
another. Some of the offspring result from fusion of two mutant gametes,
and will therefore be nonchimeric, as every one of their cells will carry the
inactivated gene. These are knockout mice, and with luck their phenotypes
will provide the desired information on the function of the gene being studied. This works well for many gene inactivations but some are lethal and so
cannot be studied in a homozygous knockout mouse. Instead, a heterozygous mouse is obtained, the product of fusion between one normal and one
mutant gamete, in the hope that the phenotypic effect of the gene inactivation will be apparent even though the mouse still has one correct copy of the
gene being studied.

Gene inactivation without homologous recombination
Homologous recombination is not the only way to disrupt a gene in order to
study its function. One alternative is to use transposon tagging, in which
inactivation is achieved by the insertion of a transposable element, or transposon, into the gene. Most genomes contain transposable elements (Section
9.2) and although the bulk of these are inactive, there are usually a few that
retain their ability to move to new positions in the genome. Under normal circumstances, transposition is a relatively rare event, but it is sometimes possible to use recombinant DNA techniques to make modified transposons that
change their position in response to an external stimulus. One way of doing
this, involving the yeast transposon Ty1, is shown in Figure 5.22. Transposon
tagging is also important in analysis of the fruit-fly genome, using the
endogenous Drosophila transposon called the P element. The weakness with
transposon tagging is that it is difficult to target individual genes, because
transposition is more or less a random event and it is impossible to predict

Genomes Chapter 5

5:26 pm

Page 151

Determining the Functions of Individual Genes

where a transposon will end up after it has jumped. If the intention is to inactivate a particular gene then it is necessary to induce a substantial number of
transpositions and then to screen all the resulting organisms to find one with
the correct insertion. Transposon tagging is therefore more applicable to
global studies of genome function, in which genes are inactivated at random
and groups of genes with similar functions identified by examining the progeny for interesting phenotype changes.
A completely different approach to gene inactivation is provided by RNA
interference, or RNAi, one of a series of natural processes by which short RNA
molecules influence gene expression in living cells (Section 12.2.6). When
used in genomics research, RNAi provides a means of inactivating a target
gene, not by disrupting the gene itself, but by destroying its mRNA. This is
accomplished by introducing into the cell short, double-stranded RNA molecules whose sequences match that of the mRNA being targeted. The doublestranded RNAs are broken down into shorter molecules, which induce degradation of the mRNA (Figure 5.23). The process was initially shown to work
effectively in the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the genome of which has been
completely sequenced and which is looked on as an important model organism for higher eukaryotes (Section 14.3.3). Virtually all of the 19,000 predicted
genes in the C. elegans genome have been individually inactivated by RNA
interference. The key step in any RNAi experiment is introducing into the test
organism the double-stranded RNA molecule that will give rise to the singlestranded interfering RNAs. With C. elegans this can be achieved by feeding the
RNA to the worms. C. elegans eats bacteria, including Escherichia coli, and is
often grown on a lawn of bacteria on an agar plate. If the bacteria contain a
cloned gene that directs expression of a double-stranded RNA with the same
sequence as a C. elegans gene then, after ingestion, the RNAi pathway begins
to operate. Alternatively, the double-stranded RNA can be directly microinjected into the worm, but this is more time-consuming.
RNA interference is known to occur naturally in a range of eukaryotes, but
applying it to mammalian cells was expected to be difficult because these
organisms display a parallel response to double-stranded RNA, in which protein synthesis is generally inhibited, resulting in cell death. This problem has
been circumvented by using double-stranded RNAs that are just 21–22 bp in
length, long enough to be specific for an individual target gene and to activate
the RNAi process, but too short to set off the protein synthesis inhibitory
response. This approach, using retroviral vectors to deliver cloned genes
expressing the RNAs into cultured cells, has enabled over 8000 of the 35,000
human genes to be individually inactivated. The current challenge for mammalian RNAi is to move from cell-based systems, in which only certain phenotypes can be assessed, to knockout mice, in which the full range of phenotypes can be examined. This requires the development of cloning systems for
the long-term, stable synthesis of the interfering RNAs, which must be present at a consistently high level in order to keep the target gene inactivated.

Gene overexpression can also be used to assess function
So far we have concentrated on techniques that result in inactivation of the
gene being studied (“loss of function”). The complementary approach is to
engineer an organism in which the test gene is much more active than normal (“gain of function”) and to determine what changes, if any, this has on the
phenotype. The results of these experiments must be treated with caution

overexpression. The objective is to
determine if overexpression of the gene
being studied has an effect on the
phenotype of a transgenic mouse. A cDNA
of the gene is therefore inserted into a
cloning vector carrying a highly active
promoter sequence that directs expression
of the cloned gene in mouse liver cells. The
cDNA is used rather than the genomic copy
of the gene because the former does not
contain introns and so is shorter and easier
to manipulate in the test tube.

because of the need to distinguish between a phenotype change that is due to
the specific function of an overexpressed gene, and a less specific phenotype
change that reflects the abnormality of the situation where a single gene
product is being synthesized in excessive amounts, possibly in tissues in
which the gene is normally inactive. Despite this qualification, overexpression has provided some important information on gene function.
To overexpress a gene, a special type of cloning vector must be used, one
designed to ensure that the cloned gene directs the synthesis of as much protein as possible. The vector is therefore multicopy, meaning that it multiplies
inside the host organism to 40–200 copies per cell, so there are many copies
of the test gene. The vector must also contain a highly active promoter
(Section 11.2.2) so that each copy of the test gene is converted into large
quantities of mRNA, again ensuring that as much protein as possible is made.
In the example shown in Figure 5.24, the cloning vector contains a highly
active promoter that is expressed only in the liver, so each transgenic mouse
overexpresses the test gene in its liver. This approach has been used with
genes whose sequences suggested that they code for proteins that are
secreted into the bloodstream. After synthesis in the liver of the transgenic
mouse, the test protein is secreted and the phenotype of the transgenic
mouse examined in the search for clues regarding the function of the cloned
gene. An interesting discovery was made when it was realized that one transgenic mouse had bones that were significantly more dense than those of normal mice. This was important for two reasons: first, it enabled the relevant
gene to be identified as one involved in bone synthesis; second, the discovery
of a protein that increases bone density has implications for the development
of treatments for human osteoporosis, a fragile-bone disease.

The phenotypic effect of gene inactivation or overexpression may be
difficult to discern
The critical aspect of a gene inactivation or overexpression experiment is the
need to identify a phenotypic change, the nature of which gives a clue to the
function of the manipulated gene. This can be much more difficult than it
sounds. With any organism the range of phenotypes that must be examined
is immense. Even with a unicellular organism such as yeast, the list is quite
lengthy (Table 5.2A) and with multicellular eukaryotes it is much more so
(Table 5.2B). In higher organisms some phenotypes (e.g., behavioral ones)
are difficult, if not impossible, to assess in a comprehensive fashion.

Chapter 5 Understanding a Genome Sequence

Furthermore, the effect of gene inactivation can be very subtle and may not
be recognized when the phenotype is examined. A good example of the
problems that occur was provided by the longest gene on yeast chromosome III which, at 2167 codons and with typical yeast codon bias, simply
had to be a functional gene rather than a spurious ORF. Inactivation of this
gene had no apparent effect, the mutant yeast cells appearing to have an
identical phenotype to normal yeast. For some time it was thought that
perhaps this gene is dispensable, its protein product either involved in
some completely nonessential function, or having a function that is duplicated by a second gene. Eventually it was shown that the mutants die when
they are grown at low pH in the presence of glucose and acetic acid, which
normal yeasts can tolerate, and it was concluded that the gene codes for a
protein that pumps acetate out of the cell. This is definitely an essential function, as the gene plays a vital role in protecting yeast from acetic acidinduced damage, but this essentiality was difficult to track down from the
phenotype tests.
Even when the most careful screens are carried out, many gene inactivations
appear to give no discernible phenotypic change. Almost 5000 of the 6000
yeast genes can be individually inactivated without causing the cells to die,
and inactivation of many of these 5000 genes has no detectable effect on the
metabolic properties of the cell under normal growth conditions. With C. elegans, large-scale gene inactivation projects have so far assigned phenotypes
to less than 10% of the 19,000 predicted genes. The implication is that in both
organisms the majority of genes play specialist roles and identifying what this
role is for every gene is going to be a lengthy and difficult process.

5.2.3 More detailed studies of the activity of a protein
coded by an unknown gene
Gene inactivation and overexpression are the primary techniques used by
genome researchers to determine the function of a new gene, but these are
not the only procedures that can provide information on gene activity. Other
methods can extend and elaborate the results of inactivation and overexpression. These can be used to provide additional information that will aid
identification of a gene function, or might form the basis of a more comprehensive examination of the activity of a protein whose gene has already
been characterized.

Directed mutagenesis can be used to probe gene function in detail
Inactivation and overexpression can determine the general function of a
gene, but they cannot provide detailed information on the activity of a protein coded by a gene. For example, it might be suspected that part of a gene
codes for an amino acid sequence that directs its protein product to a particular compartment in the cell, or is responsible for the ability of the protein to
respond to a chemical or physical signal. To test these hypotheses it would be
necessary to delete or alter the relevant part of the gene sequence, but to
leave the bulk unmodified so that the protein is still synthesized and retains
the major part of its activity. The various procedures of site-directed or in
vitro mutagenesis (Technical Note 5.2) can be used to make these subtle
changes. These are important techniques whose applications lie not only
with the study of gene activity but also in the area of protein engineering,
where the objective is to create novel proteins with properties that are better
suited for use in industrial or clinical settings.

After mutagenesis, the gene sequence must be introduced into the host cell
so that homologous recombination can replace the existing copy of the gene
with the modified version. This presents a problem because we must have a
way of knowing which cells have undergone homologous recombination.
Even with yeast this will only be a fraction of the total, and with mice the fraction will be very small. Normally we would solve this problem by placing a
marker gene (e.g., one coding for antibiotic resistance) next to the mutated
gene and looking for cells that take on the phenotype conferred by this
marker. In most cases, cells that insert the marker gene into their genome also
insert the closely attached mutated gene and so are the ones we want. The
problem is that in a site-directed mutagenesis experiment we must be sure
that any change in the activity of the gene being studied is the result of the
specific mutation that was introduced into the gene, rather than the indirect
result of changing its environment in the genome by inserting a marker gene
next to it. The answer is to use a more complex, two-step gene replacement
(Figure 5.25). In this procedure the target gene is first replaced with the
marker gene on its own, the cells in which this recombination takes place
being identified by selecting for the marker gene phenotype. These cells are
then used in the second stage of the gene replacement, when the marker gene
is replaced by the mutated gene, success now being monitored by looking for
cells that have lost the marker gene phenotype. These cells contain the
mutated gene and their phenotypes can be examined to determine the effect
of the directed mutation on the activity of the protein product.

Reporter genes and immunocytochemistry can be used to locate
where and when genes are expressed
Clues to the function of a gene can often be obtained by determining where
and when the gene is active. If gene expression is restricted to a particular
organ or tissue of a multicellular organism, or to a single set of cells within an
organ or tissue, then this positional information can be used to infer the general role of the gene product. The same is true of information relating to the
developmental stage at which a gene is expressed. This type of analysis has
proved particularly useful in understanding the activities of genes involved in
the earliest stages of development in Drosophila (Section 14.3.4) and is
increasingly being used to unravel the genetics of mammalian development.
It is also applicable to those unicellular organisms, such as yeast, that have
distinctive developmental stages in their life cycle.
Determining the pattern of gene expression within an organism is possible
with a reporter gene. This is a gene whose expression can be monitored in a
convenient way, ideally by visual examination (Table 5.3), cells that express

Chapter 5 Understanding a Genome Sequence

Technical Note 5.2 Site-directed mutagenesis
Methods for making a precise alteration in a gene sequence in order to change the structure and possibly
the activity of a protein
Changes in protein structure can be engineered by sitedirected mutagenesis techniques, which result in defined
alterations being made to the nucleotide sequence of the
gene coding for a protein of interest. These techniques
enable the functions of different parts of a protein to be
examined, and also have widespread importance in the
development of new enzymes for biotechnological purposes.

Screening of large numbers of mutated organisms is necessary to find a mutation of interest. Even with microbes, which
can be screened in huge numbers, the best that can be
hoped for is a range of mutations in the correct gene, one of
which might affect the part of the protein being studied. Sitedirected mutagenesis offers a means of making much more
specific mutations. The most important of these methods are:

Conventional mutagenesis is a random process that introduces changes at unspecified positions in a DNA molecule.

the reporter gene becoming blue, fluorescing, or giving off some other visible
signal. For the reporter gene to give a reliable indication of where and when a
test gene is expressed, the reporter must be subject to the same regulatory
signals as the test gene. This is achieved by replacing the ORF of the test gene
with the ORF of the reporter gene (Figure 5.26). Most of the regulatory signals
that control gene expression are contained in the region of DNA upstream of
the ORF, so the reporter gene should now display the same expression pattern
as the test gene. The expression pattern can therefore be determined by
examining the organism for the reporter signal.
As well as knowing in which cells a gene is expressed, it is often useful to locate
the position within the cell where the protein coded by the gene is found. For
example, key data regarding gene function can be obtained by showing that the

annealed to a single-stranded version of the relevant
gene, the latter obtained by cloning in an M13 vector
(Section 4.1.1). The oligonucleotide primes a strand synthesis reaction that is allowed to continue all the way
around the circular template molecule (Figure T5.1A).
After introduction into Escherichia coli, DNA replication
produces numerous copies of this recombinant DNA
molecule, half of these being copies of the original strand
of DNA, and half copies of the strand that contains the
mutated sequence. All of these double-stranded molecules direct synthesis of phage particles, so about half the
phages released from the infected bacteria carry a singlestranded version of the mutated molecule. The phages
are plated onto solid agar so that plaques are produced,
and the mutant ones identified by hybridization probing
with the original oligonucleotide (Figure T5.1B). The
mutated gene can then be placed back in its original host
by homologous recombination, as described in Section
5.2.3, or transferred to an E. coli vector designed for synthesis of protein from cloned DNA, so that a sample of
the mutated protein can be obtained.

The method shown in Figure T5.2 involves two PCRs,
each with one normal primer (which forms a fully basepaired hybrid with the template DNA), and one mutagenic primer (which contains a single base-pair mismatch corresponding to the mutation). This mutation is
therefore initially present in two PCR products, each corresponding to one half of the starting DNA molecule.
The two PCR products are then mixed together and a
final PCR cycle carried out to construct the full-length,
mutated DNA molecule.

protein product is located in mitochondria, in the nucleus, or on the cell surface. Reporter genes cannot help here because the DNA sequence upstream of
the gene—the sequence to which the reporter gene is attached—is not involved
in targeting the protein product to its correct intracellular location. Instead it is
the amino acid sequence of the protein itself that is important. Therefore the
only way to determine where the protein is located is to search for it directly.
This can be done by immunocytochemistry, which makes use of an antibody
that is specific for the protein of interest and so binds to this protein and no
other. The antibody is labeled so that its position in the cell, and hence the position of the target protein, can be visualized (Figure 5.27). Fluorescent labeling
and confocal microscopy are used for low-resolution studies; alternatively,
high-resolution immunocytochemistry can be carried out by electron
microscopy using an electron-dense label such as colloidal gold.

is placed under control of the regulatory
sequences that usually dictate the expression
pattern of the test gene. For more
information on these regulatory sequences,
see Sections 11.2 and 11.3. Note that the
reporter gene strategy assumes that the
important regulatory sequences do indeed
lie upstream of the gene. This is not always
the case for eukaryotic genes.

5.3 Case Study: Annotation of the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae Genome Sequence
In this chapter we have looked at a range of techniques, both computerbased and experimental, for locating the genes in a genome sequence and for
determining their functions. Not every technique has been used with every
organism, the choice often being determined by technical considerations—
for example, RNAi has been used extensively with C. elegans partly because of
the ease with which double-stranded RNAs can be introduced into worms by
feeding experiments (Section 5.2.2). To illustrate how these various techniques are combined, we will conclude this chapter by surveying the progress
made in annotating the genome of the yeast S. cerevisiae. In eukaryotic terms,
the yeast genome is relatively noncomplex, in that it contains relatively little
intergenic DNA and very few introns. This simplifies the identification of
ORFs, but provides no advantage when it comes to determining the function
of individual genes.

5.3.1 Annotation of the yeast genome sequence
The S. cerevisiae sequencing project was completed in 1996. The initial analysis, which set 100 codons as the minimum cut-off for a potential gene, identified 6274 ORFs, approximately 30% of which were known to be genuine
genes because they had previously been identified by conventional genetic
analysis before the sequencing project got underway. The remaining 70%
were studied by homology analysis when the genome sequence was completed, giving the following results (Figure 5.28):
G

Almost 30% of the genes in the genome could be assigned functions after
homology searching of the sequence databases. About half of these were
clear homologs of genes whose functions had been established previously,
and about half had less-striking similarities, including many where the
similarities were restricted to discrete domains. For all these genes the
homology analysis could be described as successful, but with various
degrees of usefulness. For some genes the identification of a homolog
enabled the function of the yeast gene to be comprehensively determined:
examples included identification of yeast genes for DNA polymerase subunits. For other genes the functional assignment could only be to a broad
category, such as “gene for a protein kinase”: in other words, the biochemical properties of the gene product could be inferred, but not the exact role
of the protein in the cell. Some identifications were initially puzzling, the
best example being the discovery of a yeast homolog of a bacterial gene
involved in nitrogen fixation. Yeasts do not fix nitrogen so this could not
be the function of the yeast gene. In this case, the discovery of the yeast
homolog refocused attention on the previously characterized bacterial
gene, with the subsequent realization that, although being involved in
nitrogen fixation, the primary role of the bacterial gene product was in the
synthesis of metal-containing proteins, which have broad roles in all
organisms, not just nitrogen-fixing ones.

G

About 10% of all the yeast genes had homologs in the databases, but the
functions of these homologs were unknown. The homology analysis was
therefore unable to help in assigning functions to these yeast genes. These
yeast genes and their homologs were called orphan families.

G

The remaining yeast genes, about 30% of the total, had no homologs in the
databases. A proportion of these (about 7% of the total) were questionable
ORFs which might not be real genes, being rather short or having an

Examination of the cell shows that the
fluorescent signal is associated with the
inner mitochondrial membrane. A working
hypothesis would therefore be that the
target protein is involved in electron
transport and oxidative phosphorylation, as
these are the main biochemical functions of
the inner mitochondrial membrane.

unusual codon bias. The remainder looked like genes but were unique.
These were called single orphans.
Following the initial annotation of the yeast genome sequence, two questions
had to be considered: First, how many of the single orphans are genuine
genes? Second, are there any genuine genes less than 100 codons in length
and hence not identified by this initial analysis? The latter is an important
point: although there are just 6274 ORFs of 100 codons and longer in the yeast
genome, there are over 100,000 ORFs of 15 codons or more, most of these displaying a pattern of codon usage that is indistinguishable from genuine yeast
genes. The potential for finding new, short genes was therefore huge.
Three approaches were used in refining the yeast gene set, all involving techniques that we have already met in this chapter:
G

Comparative genomics, making use of the suite of genome sequences
for related yeast species, was used to assess the authenticity of many
short ORFs.

G

Evidence of transcription was sought by sequencing cDNAs, including
libraries of expressed sequence tags, which are short and usually incomplete cDNAs derived from the ends of transcribed sequences (Section
3.3.3), and by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE; Section 6.1.1) and
microarray studies (Section 6.1.2).

G

Transposon tagging, as well as being used to inactivate genes as part of
the functional analysis, was used to identify ORFs that are genuine genes.
This work made use of a transposon containing a copy of the lacZ gene
that lacked its initiation codon (Figure 5.29). In normal cells the lacZ gene
is therefore inactive, so when the X-gal test is applied (Section 2.2.1) the
colonies appear white. The lacZ gene becomes activated if transposition
moves it to a position within a genuine yeast gene and the insertion results
in the codons of the yeast gene becoming fused, in frame, with the lacZ
gene. Now the colonies appear blue. Questionable ORFs can therefore be
assessed from the colour of colonies after the ORF has become tagged
with the transposon.

These experiments are continuing but their result so far has been to reduce
the yeast gene catalog to approximately 6120 ORFs, some 150 fewer than the
initial estimate. This reduction comes about by discounting many of the original single orphans, which are no longer looked on as possible genes, but also
adding into the list a few ORFs that are shorter than 100 codons but which
turn out to be genuine genes.

5.3.2 Assigning functions to yeast genes
S. cerevisiae has two features that aid attempts to assign functions to the
unknown genes in its genome. The first of these is a high natural propensity
for homologous recombination, which makes it relatively easy to use this
approach to inactivate individual genes (see Figure 5.20). The second is the
presence in the genome of the Ty family of transposons, which enable
transposon tagging to be used as an alternative means of gene disruption.
Both approaches have been used extensively by yeast researchers. The challenge now lies not in developing methods for inactivation of individual
yeast genes, but in devising ways of screening the vast numbers of resulting
mutants for novel phenotypic features that might indicate the function of
an inactivated gene. Carrying out many parallel experiments, each with a

Figure 5.29 Using transposon tagging to
identify yeast genes. If the transposon
moves into a functional yeast gene, such
that an open reading frame is created
between the start of the yeast gene and the
lacZ gene present in the transposon, then
the lacZ gene can be expressed. The
resulting b-galactoside protein has a
segment of the protein coded by the yeast
gene attached to its N–terminus, but often
this will not affect the enzyme activity.
Hence transposition into a functional yeast
gene is detectable by the X-gal test.

different mutant, takes a long time, especially when there is such a large
number of phenotypes to assess. Large-scale screening strategies are therefore needed.
The most successful of these screening methods is the barcode deletion
strategy. This is a modification of the basic deletion cassette system shown in
Figure 5.21, the difference being that the cassette also includes two 20nucleotide “barcode” sequences, different for each deletion, which act as tags
for that particular mutant (Figure 5.30). Each barcode is flanked by the same
pair of sequences and so can be amplified by a single PCR. This means that
groups of mutated yeast strains, each with a different inactivated gene, can be
mixed together and their phenotypes screened in a single experiment. For
example, to identify genes required for growth in a glucose-rich medium, a
collection of mutants would be mixed together and cultured under these conditions. After incubation, DNA is prepared from the culture and the barcoding PCR carried out. The result is a mixture of PCR products, each representing a different barcode, the relative abundance of each barcode indicating the
abundance of each mutant after growth in glucose-rich medium. Those barcodes that are absent or present only at low abundance indicate the mutants
whose inactivated genes were needed for growth under these conditions.
As with gene identification, functional characterization of yeast genes is ongoing and it will be several years before this project begins to near completion. But
progress is gradually being made. Approximately 55% of all yeast genes now
have a well-characterized function that has been assigned by one or more
experimental techniques. This is some 1500 genes more than was the case when
the genome was first sequenced. Another 2000 genes—33% of the total—have
functions that have been assigned on the basis of homology analysis. This leaves
just 500 ORFs, which are thought to be genuine genes but have no assigned
function, and another 300 questionable ORFs that may not be real genes.

Summary
A variety of methods have been devised for identifying the genes in a genome
and determining the functions of these genes. Some of the methods are computer-based, and others involve experimentation. When a genome sequence
is first obtained, the initial objective is to locate the positions of all the genes.
For protein-coding genes this can be attempted by searching for open reading
frames (ORFs), though this is complicated in eukaryotes by the presence of
introns, whose boundary sequences are variable and cannot be identified
accurately. Genes for functional RNAs can also be located by searching for
their characteristic features, primarily the ability of the RNAs to fold into secondary structures based on the formation of base-paired stem-loops. Genes
can also be located by homology analysis, which uses the presence of an
equivalent gene in a second genome as evidence that a putative gene in the
test genome is genuine. Homology analysis is made more powerful if the complete sequence of a related genome is available. Experimental methods for
gene location are based on detection of RNA molecules transcribed from the
genome. These methods include cDNA sequencing and transcript mapping by
reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) or heteroduplex analysis. Gene functions
can tentatively be assigned by homology analysis, because homologs are evolutionarily related and often, but not always, have similar functions. Most
experimental techniques for determining the functions of genes involve

Summary

examining the effect that gene inactivation has on the phenotype of the organism. Inactivation can be achieved in various ways: by homologous recombination with a defective copy of the gene, by insertion of a transposon into the
gene, or by RNA interference, the last of these approaches having been particularly successful with Caenorhabditis elegans. Gene overexpression can also
be used to assess function, but with both inactivation and overexpression it
may be difficult to discern a phenotypic change, and the precise function of
the gene may remain elusive. More detailed studies of gene function can be
carried out by site-directed mutagenesis, and the cellular location of a protein
can be determined by expression of a reporter gene or by immunocytochemistry. When the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence was completed in
1996, 6274 ORFs that might be genes were identified, but this figure has now
been revised to 6120 following experimental analysis and comparisons with
other yeast genomes. Initially only 30% of these genes had well-characterized
functions, but this number has gradually been increased by homology analysis and by the application of high-throughput functional screens such as the
barcode deletion strategy.

When you have read Chapter 6, you should be able to:
Describe how a transcriptome can be studied by sequence analysis of cDNAs.
Evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of microarray and chip technology in the study of
transcriptomes, and explain how comparisons are made between gene expression patterns
revealed by these studies.
Give examples of the contributions that transcriptome studies have made to our understanding of
yeast biology and human cancer.
Distinguish between the different types of information that are obtained by studying transcriptomes
and proteomes.
Describe how protein profiling is carried out.
Compare and contrast the methods used to identify pairs and groups of proteins that interact with
one another in living cells, in particular distinguishing between methods that identify physical
interactions and those that identify functional interactions.
Give examples of protein interaction maps and discuss their important features.
Explain the basis to and importance of biochemical profiling.
Outline the principles and objectives of systems biology.

In the previous chapter we learnt how a variety of computational and experimental techniques can be used to assign functions to genes discovered
within a genome sequence, and how application of these techniques to the
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome has almost doubled the number of yeast
genes for which definite functions are known. This type of genome annotation is a massive undertaking, but even if every gene in a genome can be identified and assigned a function, a challenge still remains. This is to understand
how the genome as a whole operates within the cell, specifying and coordinating the various biochemical activities that take place. These global studies
of genome activity must address not only the genome itself but also the transcriptome and proteome that are synthesized and maintained by the

are ligated to produce the concatamer that

concatamer that is formed is made up
partly of sequences derived from the BsmFI

genome. They must also address the way in which the transcriptome and proteome establish and coordinate the ultimate endpoint of genome expression—the network of linked biochemical pathways and processes that constitute a living cell. In this chapter we will look at the methods used in these
global studies of genome activity.

6.1 Studying the Transcriptome
The transcriptome comprises the mRNAs that are present in a cell at a particular time. Transcriptomes can have highly complex compositions, with hundreds or thousands of different mRNAs represented, each making up a different fraction of the overall population (Section 1.2.4). To characterize a transcriptome it is therefore necessary to identify the mRNAs that it contains and,
ideally, to determine their relative abundances.

6.1.1 Studying a transcriptome by sequence analysis
The most direct way to characterize a transcriptome is to convert its mRNA
into cDNA (see Figure 3.36), and then to sequence every clone in the resulting cDNA library. Comparisons between the cDNA sequences and the
genome sequence will reveal the identities of the genes whose mRNAs are
present in the transcriptome. This approach is feasible but it is laborious,
with many different cDNA sequences being needed before a near-complete
picture of the composition of the transcriptome begins to emerge. If two or
more transcriptomes are being compared then the time needed to complete
the project increases. Can any shortcuts be used to obtain the vital sequence
information more quickly?
Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) provides a solution. Rather than
studying complete cDNAs, SAGE yields short sequences, as little as 12 bp in
length, each of which represents an mRNA present in the transcriptome. The
basis of the technique is that these 12 bp sequences, despite their shortness,
are sufficient to enable the gene that codes for the mRNA to be identified. The
argument is that any particular 12 bp sequence should appear in the genome
once every 412 = 16,777,216 bp. The average size of a eukaryotic mRNA is
about 1500 bp, so 412 bp is equivalent to the combined length of over 11,000
transcripts. This number is higher than the number of transcripts expected in
all but the most complex transcriptomes, so the 12 bp sequence tags should
be able to identify the genes coding for all the mRNAs that are present.
The procedure used to generate the 12 bp tags is shown in Figure 6.1. First,
the mRNA is immobilized in a chromatography column by annealing the
poly(A) tails present at the 3¢ ends of these molecules to oligo(dT) strands that
have been attached to cellulose beads. The mRNA is converted into doublestranded cDNA and then treated with a restriction enzyme that recognizes a
4 bp target site and so cuts frequently in each cDNA. The terminal restriction
fragment of each cDNA remains attached to the cellulose beads, enabling all
the other fragments to be eluted and discarded. A short oligonucleotide is
now attached to the free end of each cDNA, this oligonucleotide containing a
recognition sequence for BsmFI. This is an unusual restriction enzyme in that
rather than cutting within its recognition sequence, it cuts 10–14 nucleotides
downstream. Treatment with BsmFI therefore removes a fragment with an
average length of 12 bp from the end of each cDNA. The fragments are collected, ligated head-to-tail to produce a concatamer, and sequenced. The

individual tag sequences are identified within the concatamer and compared
with the sequences of the genes in the genome.

Microarray

6.1.2 Studying a transcriptome by microarray or chip
analysis
DNA chips and microarrays (see Technical Note 3.1) can also be used to study
transcriptomes. Recall that the difference between these is that a chip carries
an array of immobilized oligonucleotides synthesized in situ on the surface of
a wafer of glass or silicon, and microarrays comprise DNA molecules—usually PCR products or cDNAs—that have been spotted onto the surface of a
glass slide or nylon membrane. Microarrays and chips are both used in the
same way (Figure 6.2). The population of mRNAs that make up a transcriptome is converted into a mixture of cDNAs, labeled (usually with a fluorescent
marker), and applied to the microarray or chip, and the positions at which
hybridization occurs are detected. Compared with SAGE, this approach has
the advantage that a rapid evaluation of the differences between two or more
transcriptomes can be made by hybridizing different cDNA preparations to
identical arrays and comparing the hybridization patterns. A further embellishment can be achieved by probing the array with cDNA that has been prepared from the mRNA fraction that is bound to ribosomes in the cells being
studied, rather than from total mRNA. The bound mRNAs correspond to the
part of the transcriptome that is actively directing protein synthesis, giving a
slightly different picture of genome activity.
First we will consider the technical issues involved in microarray and chip
studies, and then we will consider some of the applications of this type of
analysis.

Using a microarray or chip to study one or more transcriptomes
When a transcriptome is analyzed, the two key objectives are to identify the
genes whose mRNAs are present, and to determine the relative amounts of
these various mRNAs. The first of these requirements demands that every relevant gene be represented by at least one probe in the array. With a microarray, this is achieved by using PCR products or cDNAs that are derived from
the genes of interest, and with a DNA chip by synthesizing at each position a
mixture of oligonucleotides, perhaps as many as 20 different ones in total, the
sequences of which match different positions in the relevant gene (Figure
6.3). The second requirement—the ability to determine the relative amounts
of individual mRNAs in the transcriptome—is met because each position in

Amount of probe

the microarray or chip contains up to 109 copies of the probe molecules. This
is higher than the anticipated copy number for any mRNA in the small
amount of the transcriptome that is applied to the array, which means that no
position ever becomes saturated (i.e., so much hybridization that every probe
molecule is base-paired to a target molecule). The amount of hybridization is
therefore variable, the signal intensity at each position depending on the
amount of each particular mRNA in the transcriptome (Figure 6.4).
From reading the above, microarray and chip analysis might appear to be
straightforward procedures. In practice, a number of complications arise. The
first is that, with all but the simplest transcriptomes, hybridization analysis
will have insufficient specificity to distinguish between every mRNA that is
present. This is because two different mRNAs might have similar sequences
and may then cross-hybridize to each other’s specific probe on the array. This
often happens when two or more paralogous genes (Section 5.2.1) are active
in the same tissue. The transcriptome then contains a group of related
mRNAs, each of which is able to hybridize to some extent with different
members of the gene family. Distinguishing the relative amounts of each
mRNA, or even being certain which particular mRNAs are present, can then

be difficult. A similar problem arises when two or more different mRNAs are
derived from the same gene. This is relatively common in vertebrates because
of alternative splicing, the process by which exons from a pre-mRNA are
assembled in different combinations to give a series of related but different
mRNAs (Figure 6.5). The array must be designed very carefully if all of these
variants are to be detected and accurately quantified.
Further complications arise if the objective is to compare two or more transcriptomes, which, as we will see below, is a frequent scenario. For comparisons to be valid, differences between the hybridization intensities for the
same gene with two different microarrays or chips must represent genuine
differences in mRNA amount, and not be due to experimental factors such as
the amount of target DNA on the array, the efficiency with which the probe
has been labeled, or the effectiveness of the hybridization process. Even in a
single laboratory, these factors can rarely be controlled with absolute precision, and exact reproducibility between different laboratories is more or less
impossible. This means that the data analysis must include normalization
procedures that enable results from different array experiments to be accurately compared. The arrays must therefore include negative controls so that
the background can be determined in each experiment, as well as positive
controls that should always give identical signals. For vertebrate transcriptomes, the actin gene is often used as a positive control as its expression level
tends to be fairly constant in a particular tissue, regardless of the developmental stage or disease state. A more satisfactory alternative is to design the
experiment so that the two transcriptomes can be directly compared, in a single analysis using a single array. This is done by labeling the cDNA preparations with different fluorescent probes, and then scanning the array at the
appropriate wavelengths to determine the relative intensities of the two fluorescent signals at each position, and hence to determine the differences
between the mRNA contents of the two transcriptomes (Figure 6.6).

Presuming accurate comparisons can be made between two or more transcriptomes, quite complex differences in gene expression patterns can be distinguished. Genes that display similar expression profiles are likely to be ones
with related functions, and a rigorous method is needed for identifying these
groups. The standard method, which is called hierarchical clustering,
involves comparing the expression levels of every pair of genes in every transcriptome that has been analyzed, and assigning a value that indicates the
degree of relatedness between those expression levels. These data can be
expressed as a dendrogram, in which genes with related expression profiles
are clustered together (Figure 6.7). The dendrogram gives a clear visual indication of the functional relationships between genes.

Studies of the yeast transcriptome
With just over 6000 genes, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is ideally suited
for transcriptome studies, and many of the pioneering projects have been carried out with this organism. One of the first discoveries was that although
mRNAs are being degraded and resynthesized all the time, the composition of
the yeast transcriptome undergoes very little change if the biochemical features of the environment remain constant. When yeast is grown in a glucoserich medium, which allows the cells to divide at their maximum rate, the transcriptome is almost completely stable, only 19 mRNAs displaying a greater
than twofold change in abundance over a period of two hours. Significant
alterations to the transcriptome are seen only when the glucose in the growth
medium becomes depleted, forcing the cells to switch from aerobic to anaerobic respiration. During this switch, the levels of over 700 mRNAs increase by
a factor of two or more, and another 1000 mRNAs decline to less than half
their original amount. The changing environment clearly results in a restructuring of the transcriptome to meet the new biochemical demands of the cell.
The yeast transcriptome also undergoes restructuring during cellular differentiation. This has been established by studying sporulation (spore formation), which is induced by starvation and other stressful environmental conditions. The sporulation pathway can be divided into four stages—early, middle, mid-late, and late—on the basis of the morphological and biochemical
events that occur (Figure 6.8). Previous studies have shown, not unexpectedly, that each stage is characterized by expression of a different set of genes.
Transcriptome studies have added to our understanding of the sporulation
process in several ways. Most significantly, the changes that occur to the composition of the transcriptome indicate that the early stage of sporulation can
be subdivided into three distinct phases, called early (I), early (II), and earlymiddle. The levels of over 250 mRNAs increase significantly during early
sporulation, and another 158 mRNAs increase specifically during the middle
stage. A further 61 mRNAs increase in abundance during the mid-late period,
and 5 more during the late phase. There are also 600 mRNAs that decrease in
abundance during sporulation, these presumably coding for proteins that are

needed during vegetative growth but whose synthesis must be switched off
when spores are being formed.
This work on yeast sporulation is important for two reasons. First, by describing the changes in genome expression that occur during sporulation, the
transcriptome analyses open the way to studies of the interactions between
the genome and the environmental signals that trigger sporulation. Studies of
this type, in a relatively simple organism such as yeast, act as an important
model for the more complex developmental processes that operate in higher
eukaryotes, including humans. Second, several of the mRNAs whose levels
change significantly during sporulation are transcripts of genes whose functions were previously unknown. Transcriptome studies therefore help to
annotate a genome sequence, aiding identification of genes whose roles in
the genome have not been determined by other methods.

The human transcriptome
With five times as many genes, the human transcriptome is substantially
more complex than that of yeast, and studies of its composition are still in
their infancy. Some interesting results have, nonetheless, been obtained. For
example, the transcriptomes of different cell types have been mapped onto
the human genome sequence, resulting in global views of the pattern of gene
expression along entire chromosomes. This has led to the important discovery that transcripts are made of regions of the genome in which no genes are
known to exist. For example, DNA chips have been prepared whose individual oligonucleotide probes target positions occurring, on average, every

35 nucleotides along chromosomes 21 and 22. These tiling arrays comprise
over one million probes, but only 26,000 of these lie within the exons present
on these chromosomes. However, over 350,000 of the probes detected an
mRNA in at least one of 11 human transcriptomes, from different cell lines,
that were studied (Figure 6.9). Across the entire genome, some 10,500 transcribed sequences have been identified from regions of the genome not previously thought to contain any genes. This work illustrates the important role
that transcriptome analysis can play in genome annotation.
Transcriptome analysis is also having a major impact on studies of human
disease, especially cancer. Transcriptome restructuring as a result of cancer
was first discovered in 1997, when it was shown that 289 mRNAs are present
in significantly different amounts in the transcriptomes of normal colon
epithelial cells compared with cancerous colon cells, and that about half of
these mRNAs also display an altered abundance in pancreatic cancer cells.
These are important observations as understanding the differences between
the transcriptomes of normal and cancerous cells points to differences in
their biochemistries and hence to new ways of treating the cancers.
Transcriptome studies also have applications in cancer diagnosis. The initial
breakthrough in this respect came in 1999, when it was shown that the transcriptome of acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells is different from that of acute
myeloid leukemia cells. Twenty-seven lymphoblastic and eleven myeloid cancers were studied and, although all the transcriptomes were slightly different,
the distinctions between the two types were sufficient for unambiguous identifications to be made. The significance of this work lies with the improved
remission rates that are achievable if a cancer is identified accurately at an
early stage, before clear morphological indicators are seen. This is not relevant
with these two types of leukemia because these can be distinguished by nongenetic means, but it is important with other cancers such as non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. The commonest version of this disease is called diffuse large

Studying the Proteome

B-cell lymphoma, and for many years it was thought that all tumors of this
type were the same. Transcriptome studies changed this view and showed
that B-cell lymphoma can be divided into two distinct subtypes. The distinctions between the transcriptomes of the two subtypes enable each one to be
related to a different class of B cells, stimulating and directing the search for
specific treatments that are tailored for each lymphoma.

6.2 Studying the Proteome
Proteome studies are important because of the central role that the proteome
plays as the link between the genome and the biochemical capability of the
cell (Section 1.3.2). Characterization of the proteomes of different cells is
therefore the key to understanding how the genome operates and how dysfunctional genome activity can lead to diseases. Transcriptome studies can
only partly address these issues. Examination of the transcriptome gives an
accurate indication of which genes are active in a particular cell, but gives a
less accurate indication of the proteins that are present. This is because the
factors that influence protein content include not only the amount of mRNA
that is available but also the rate at which the mRNAs are translated into protein and the rate at which the proteins are degraded. Additionally, the protein
that is the initial product of translation may not be active, as some proteins
must undergo physical and/or chemical modification before becoming functional (Section 13.3). Determining the amount of the active form of a protein
is therefore critical to understanding the biochemistry of a cell or tissue.
The methodology used to study proteomes is called proteomics. Strictly
speaking, proteomics is a collection of diverse techniques that are related only
in their ability to provide information on a proteome, that information
encompassing not only the identities of the constituent proteins that are present but also factors such as the functions of individual proteins and their localization within the cell. The particular technique that is used to study the composition of a proteome is called protein profiling or expression proteomics.

6.2.1 Protein profiling—methodology for identifying the
proteins in a proteome
Protein profiling is based on two techniques—protein electrophoresis and
mass spectrometry—both of which have long pedigrees but which were
rarely applied together in the pregenomics era. Today they have been combined into one of the major growth areas of modern research.

Separating the proteins in a proteome
In order to characterize a proteome, it is first necessary to prepare pure samples of its constituent proteins. This is a far from trivial undertaking in view of
the complexity of the average proteome: remember that a mammalian cell
may contain 10,000–20,000 different proteins (Section 1.3.2).
Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (see Technical Note 4.1) is the standard
method for separating the proteins in a mixture. Depending on the composition of the gel and the conditions under which the electrophoresis is carried
out, different chemical and physical properties of proteins can be used as the
basis for their separation. The most frequently used technique makes use of
the detergent called sodium dodecyl sulfate, which denatures proteins and

confers a negative charge that is roughly equivalent to the length of the
unfolded polypeptide. Under these conditions, the proteins separate according to their molecular masses, the smallest proteins migrating more quickly
towards the positive electrode. Alternatively, proteins can be separated by
isoelectric focusing in a gel that contains chemicals which establish a pH
gradient when the electrical charge is applied. In this type of gel, a protein
migrates to its isoelectric point, the position in the gradient where its net
charge is zero. In protein profiling, these methods are combined in twodimensional gel electrophoresis. In the first dimension, the proteins are separated by isoelectric focusing. The gel is then soaked in sodium dodecyl sulfate, rotated by 90˚, and a second electrophoresis, separating the proteins
according to their sizes, is carried out at right angles to the first (Figure 6.10).
This approach can separate several thousand proteins in a single gel.
After electrophoresis, staining the gel reveals a complex pattern of spots, each
one containing a different protein (Figure 6.11). When two gels are compared,
differences in the pattern and intensities of the spots indicate differences in
the identities and relative amounts of individual proteins in the two proteomes that are being studied. Interesting spots can therefore be targeted for
the second stage of profiling in which actual protein identities are determined, as described below. However, before moving on to this stage, we must
recognize that two-dimensional gel electrophoresis has limitations that can

Studying the Proteome

have a significant impact on the overall utility of protein profiling as a means
of studying a proteome. The most significant problem is that not all proteins
in the proteome will be visible in the gel, and in particular, proteins that are
not soluble in an aqueous buffer, such as many of the proteins present in cell
membranes, will be absent. In order to study these components of the proteome, special buffers and gel compositions must be used, which means that
several parallel experiments must be carried out if the objective is to study a
proteome in its entirety. There are also problems with the reproducibility of
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the difficulty in devising control
procedures that enable the data from such gels to be normalized when two
proteomes are compared. For these reasons, alternative separation methods
are being sought, with attention currently on high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and free flow isoelectric focusing.

Identifying the proteins in a proteome
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis results in a complex pattern of spots, each
one representing a different protein. How do we identify which protein is present in a spot? This used to be a difficult proposition but advances in mass spectrometry have provided the rapid and accurate identification procedure dictated by the requirements of genome studies. Mass spectrometry was originally
designed as a means of identifying a compound from the mass-to-charge ratios
of the ionized forms that are produced when molecules of the compound are
exposed to a high-energy field. The standard technique could not be used with
proteins because they are too large to be ionized effectively, but a new procedure, called matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF), gets around this problem, at least with peptides of up to 50
amino acids in length. Of course, most proteins are much longer than 50 amino
acids, and it is therefore necessary to break them into fragments before examining them by MALDI-TOF. The standard approach is to purify the protein from
a spot and then digest it with a sequence-specific protease, such as trypsin,
which cleaves proteins immediately after arginine or lysine residues. With most
proteins, this results in a series of peptides 5–75 amino acids in length.
Once ionized, the mass-to-charge ratio of a peptide is determined from its
“time-of-flight” within the mass spectrometer as it passes from the ionization
source to the detector (Figure 6.12). The mass-to-charge ratio enables the
molecular mass to be worked out, which in turn allows the amino acid composition of the peptide to be deduced. If a number of peptides from a single
protein spot in the two-dimensional gel are analyzed, then the resulting compositional information can be related to the genome sequence in order to
identify the gene that specifies that protein. The amino acid compositions of
the peptides derived from a single protein can also be used to check that the
gene sequence is correct, and in particular to ensure that exon–intron boundaries have been correctly located. This not only helps to delineate the exact
position of a gene in a genome (Section 5.1.1), it also allows alternative splicing pathways to be identified in cases where two or more proteins are derived
from the same gene.
If two proteomes are being compared then a key requirement is that proteins
that are present in different amounts can be identified. If the differences are
relatively large, then they will be apparent simply by looking at the stained
gels after two-dimensional electrophoresis. However, important changes in
the biochemical properties of a proteome can result from relatively minor

small-scale changes are therefore essential. One possibility is to label the constituents of two proteomes with different fluorescent markers, and then run
them together in a single two-dimensional gel. This is the same strategy as is
used for comparing pairs of transcriptomes (see Figure 6.6). Visualization of
the two-dimensional gel at different wavelengths enables the intensities of
equivalent spots to be judged more accurately than is possible when two separate gels are obtained. A more accurate alternative is to label each proteome
with an isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT). These markers can be obtained in
two forms, one containing normal hydrogen atoms and the other containing

resulting from peptides containing normal
hydrogen atoms are shown in blue, and

deuterium, the heavy isotope of hydrogen. The normal and heavy versions
can be distinguished by mass spectrometry, enabling the relative amounts of
a protein in two proteomes that have been mixed together to be determined
during the MALDI-TOF stage of the profiling procedure (Figure 6.13).

6.2.2 Identifying proteins that interact with one another
Important data pertaining to genome activity can also be obtained by identifying pairs and groups of proteins that interact with one another. At a detailed
level, this information is often valuable when attempts are made to assign a
function to a newly discovered gene or protein (Section 5.2) because an interaction with a second, well-characterized protein can often indicate the role of
an unknown protein. For example, an interaction with a protein that is
located on the cell surface might indicate that an unknown protein is
involved in cell–cell signaling (Section 14.1). At a global level, the construction of protein interaction maps is looked on as an important step in linking
the proteome with the cellular biochemistry.

Identifying pairs of interacting proteins by phage display and
two-hybrid studies
There are several methods for studying protein–protein interactions, the two
most useful being phage display and the yeast two-hybrid system. In phage
display a special type of cloning vector is used, one based on l bacteriophage
or one of the filamentous bacteriophages such as M13. The vector is designed
so that a new gene that is cloned into it is expressed in such a way that its protein product becomes fused with one of the phage coat proteins (Figure
6.14A). The phage protein therefore carries the foreign protein into the phage

bacteriophage genome with a unique
restriction site located within a gene for a
coat protein. The technique was originally
carried out with the gene III coat protein of
the filamentous phage called f1, but has
now been extended to other phages
including l. To create a display phage, the
DNA sequence coding for the test protein is
ligated into the restriction site so that a
fused reading frame is produced—one in
which the series of codons continues
unbroken from the test gene into the coat
protein gene. After transformation of
Escherichia coli, this recombinant molecule
directs synthesis of a hybrid protein made
up of the test protein fused to the coat
protein. Phage particles produced by these
transformed bacteria therefore display the
test protein in their coats. (B) Using a
phage display library. The test protein is
immobilized within a well of a microtiter
tray and the phage display library added.
After washing, the phages that are retained
in the well are those displaying a protein
that interacts with the test protein.

coat, where it is “displayed” in a form that enables it to interact with other
proteins that the phage encounters. There are several ways in which phage
display can be used to study protein interactions. In one method, the test protein is displayed and interactions sought with a series of purified proteins or
protein fragments of known function. This approach is limited because it
takes time to carry out each test, so is feasible only if some prior information
has been obtained about likely interactions. A more powerful strategy is to
prepare a phage display library, a collection of clones displaying a range of
proteins, and identify which members of the library interact with the test protein (Figure 6.14B).
Figure 6.15 The yeast two-hybrid system.
(A) On the left, a gene for a human protein
has been ligated to the gene for the DNAbinding domain of a yeast activator. After
transformation of yeast, this construct
specifies a fusion protein, part human
protein and part yeast activator. On the right,
various human DNA fragments have been
ligated to the gene for the activation domain
of the activator: these constructs specify a
variety of fusion proteins. (B) The two sets
of constructs are mixed and cotransformed
into yeast. A colony in which the reporter
gene is expressed contains fusion proteins
whose human segments interact, thereby
bringing the DNA-binding and activation
domains into proximity and stimulating the
RNA polymerase. See Section 11.3.2 for
more information on activators.

The yeast two-hybrid system detects protein interactions in a more complex
way. In Section 11.3.2 we will see that proteins called activators are responsible for controlling the expression of genes in eukaryotes. To carry out this
function an activator must bind to a DNA sequence upstream of a gene and
stimulate the RNA polymerase enzyme that copies the gene into RNA. These
two abilities—DNA-binding and polymerase activation—are specified by different parts of the activator, and some activators will work even after cleavage
into two segments, one segment containing the DNA-binding domain and
one containing the activation domain. In the cell, the two segments interact
to form the functional activator.
The two-hybrid system makes use of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that
lacks an activator for a reporter gene. This gene is therefore switched off. An
artificial gene that codes for the DNA-binding domain of the activator is ligated to the gene for the protein whose interactions we wish to study. This
protein can come from any organism, not just yeast: in the example shown

in Figure 6.15A it is a human protein. After introduction into yeast, this construct specifies synthesis of a fusion protein made up of the DNA-binding
domain of the activator attached to the human protein. The recombinant
yeast strain is still unable to express the reporter gene because the modified
activator only binds to DNA; it cannot influence the RNA polymerase.
Activation only occurs after the yeast strain has been cotransformed with a
second construct, one comprising the coding sequence for the activation
domain fused to a DNA fragment that specifies a protein able to interact
with the human protein that is being tested (Figure 6.15B). As with phage
display, if there is some prior knowledge about possible interactions then
individual DNA fragments can be tested one by one in the two-hybrid system. Usually, however, the gene for the activation domain is ligated with a
mixture of DNA fragments so that many different constructs are made. After
transformation, cells are plated out and those that express the reporter gene
identified. These are cells that have taken up a copy of the gene for the activation domain fused to a DNA fragment that encodes a protein able to interact with the test protein.

Identifying the components of multiprotein complexes
Phage display and the yeast two-hybrid system are effective methods for
identifying pairs of proteins that interact with one another, but identifying
such links reveals only the basic level of protein–protein interactions. Many
cellular activities are carried out by multiprotein complexes, such as the
mediator which plays a central role in regulation of gene transcription
(Section 11.3.2) or the spliceosome which is responsible for the removal of
introns from pre-mRNA (Section 12.2.2). Complexes such as these typically
comprise a set of core proteins, which are present at all times, along with a
variety of ancillary proteins that associate with the complex under particular
circumstances. Identifying the core and ancillary proteins is a critical step
toward understanding how these complexes carry out their functions. These
proteins might be identified pair-by-pair by a long series of two-hybrid experiments, but a more direct route to determining the composition of multiprotein complexes is clearly needed.
In principle, a phage display library can be used to identify the members of a
multiprotein complex, as in this procedure all proteins that interact with the
test protein are identified in a single experiment (see Figure 6.14). The problem is that large proteins are displayed inefficiently as they disrupt the phage
replication cycle, and to circumvent this problem it is generally necessary to
display a short peptide, representing part of a cellular protein, rather than the
entire protein. The displayed peptide may therefore be unable to interact with
all members of the complex within which the intact protein is located,
because the peptide lacks some of the protein–protein attachment sites present in the intact form (Figure 6.16). A method that avoids this problem,
because it works with intact proteins, is affinity chromatography. In affinity
chromatography, the test protein is attached to a chromatography resin and
placed in a column (see Technical Note 2.3). The cell extract is passed through
the column in a low-salt buffer, which allows formation of the hydrogen bonds
that hold proteins together in a complex (Figure 6.17A). The proteins that
interact with the bound test protein are therefore retained in the column,
while all the others are washed away. The interacting proteins are then eluted
with a high-salt buffer. A disadvantage of this procedure is the need to purify
the test protein, which is time-consuming and difficult to use as the basis to a

binding sites lie on a different part of the

large screening programme. In the more sophisticated method called tandem-affinity purification (TAP), which was developed as a means of studying
protein complexes in S. cerevisiae, the gene for the test protein is modified so
that the protein, when synthesized, has a C–terminal extension that binds to a
second protein called calmodulin. The cell extract is prepared under gentle
conditions so that multiprotein complexes do not break down, and the extract
is then passed through an affinity chromatography column packed with a
resin containing attached calmodulin molecules. This results in immobilization both of the test protein and others with which it is associated (Figure
6.17B). In both techniques, the identities of the purified proteins are determined by mass spectrometry. When used in a large-scale screen of 1739 yeast
genes, TAP identified 232 multiprotein complexes, providing new insights into
the functions of 344 genes, many of which had not previously been characterized by experimental means.
A disadvantage with affinity chromatography methods is that a single member of a multiprotein complex is used as the “bait” for isolation of other proteins from that complex. In practice, if a member of a complex does not interact directly with the bait, then it may not be isolated (Figure 6.18). The methods therefore identify groups of proteins that are present in a complex, but do
not necessarily provide the total protein complement of the complex.
Developing ways of purifying intact complexes is therefore a major goal of
current research. In coimmunoprecipitation, a cell extract is prepared under
gentle conditions so that complexes remain intact. An antibody specific for
the test protein is then added, which results in precipitation of this protein
and all other members of the complex within which it is present. More
sophisticated is the multi-dimensional protein identification technique
(MudPIT), which combines various chromatography techniques (e.g.,
reversed-phase liquid chromatography with either cation-exchange or sizeexclusion chromatography) in order to isolate intact complexes. The components of a complex can then be identified by mass spectrometry. This method
was first used to study the large subunit of the yeast ribosome, and resulted
in identification of 11 proteins that had not previously been known to be
associated with this complex.

Identifying proteins with functional interactions
Proteins do not need to form physical associations with one another in order
to have a functional interaction. For example, in bacteria such as Escherichia
coli, the enzymes lactose permease and b-galactosidase have a functional
interaction in that they are both involved in utilization of lactose as a carbon
source. But there is no physical interaction between these two proteins: the
permease is located in the cell membrane and transports lactose into the cell,
and b-galactosidase, which splits lactose into glucose and galactose, is present
in the cell cytoplasm (see Figure 8.8A). Many enzymes that work together in the

Genomes Chapter 6

Studying the Proteome

same biochemical pathway never form physical interactions with one another,
and if studies were to be based solely on detection of physical associations
between proteins then many functional interactions would be overlooked.
Several methods can be used to identify proteins that have functional interactions. Most of these do not involve direct study of the proteins themselves
and hence, strictly speaking, do not come under the general heading of “proteomics.” Nonetheless, it is convenient to consider them here because the
information they yield is often included, along with the results of proteomics
studies, in protein interaction maps. These methods include the following:
G

Comparative genomics can be used in various ways to identify groups of
proteins that have functional relationships. One approach is based on the
observation that pairs of proteins that are separate molecules in some
organisms are fused into a single polypeptide chain in others. An example is provided by the yeast gene HIS2, which codes for an enzyme
involved in histidine biosynthesis. In E. coli, two genes are homologous to
HIS2. One of these, itself called his2, has sequence similarity with the 5¢
region of the yeast gene, and the second, his10, is similar to the 3¢ region
(Figure 6.19). The implication is that the proteins coded by his2 and his10
interact within the E. coli proteome to provide part of the histidine
biosynthesis activity. Analysis of the sequence databases reveals many
examples of this type, where two proteins in one organism have become
fused into a single protein in another organism. A similar approach is
based on examination of bacterial operons. An operon consists of two or
more genes that are transcribed together and which usually have a functional relationship (Section 8.2). For example, the genes for the lactose
permease and b-galactosidase of E. coli are present in the same operon,
along with the gene for a third protein involved in lactose utilization. The
identities of genes in bacterial operons can therefore be used to infer
functional interactions between the proteins coded by homologous
genes in a eukaryotic genome.

G

Transcriptome studies can identify functional interactions between proteins, as the mRNAs for functionally related proteins often display similar
expression profiles under different conditions.

G

Gene inactivation studies can be informative. If a change in phenotype is
observed only when two or more genes are inactivated together, then it
can be inferred that those genes function together in generation of the
phenotype.

Protein interaction maps
Protein interaction maps, also called interactome networks, display all of the
interactions that occur between the components of a proteome. The first of
these maps were constructed in 2001 for relatively simple proteomes, almost
entirely from two-hybrid experiments. These included maps for the bacterium Helicobacter pylori, comprising over 1200 interactions involving
almost half of the proteins in the proteome, and for 2240 interactions
between 1870 proteins from the S. cerevisiae proteome (Figure 6.20A). More
recently, the application of additional techniques has led to more detailed
versions of the S. cerevisiae map, including ones in which the interactions
between (not within) multiprotein clusters are illustrated (Figure 6.20B).
Maps have also been generated for the first time for more complex species
such as Caenorhabditis elegans.

What interesting features have emerged from these protein interaction maps?
The most intriguing discovery is that each network is built up around a small
number of proteins that have many interactions, and which form hubs in the
network, along with a much larger number of proteins with few individual
connections (Figure 6.21A). This architecture is thought to minimize the
effect on the proteome of the disruptive effects of mutations which might
inactivate individual proteins. Only if a mutation affects one of the proteins
at a highly interconnected node will the network as a whole be damaged. This
hypothesis is consistent with the discovery, from gene inactivation studies
(Section 5.2.2), that a substantial number of yeast proteins are apparently
redundant, meaning that if the protein activity is destroyed, the proteome as
a whole continues to function normally, with no discernible impact on the
phenotype of the cell. Examination of the expression profiles of the hub proteins and their direct partners enables these hubs to be divided into two
groups. The first group are those hub proteins that interact with all their partners simultaneously. These are called “party” hubs and their removal has little effect on the overall structure of the network (Figure 6.21B). In contrast,
removal of the second group, the “date” hubs, which interact with different
partners at different times, breaks the network into a series of small subnetworks (Figure 6.21C). The implication is that the party hubs work within individual biological processes, and do not contribute greatly to the overall
organization of the proteome. The date hubs, on the other hand, are the key
players that provide an organization to the proteome by linking biological
processes to one another.

6.3 Beyond the Proteome
The proteome is traditionally looked on as the end-product of genome
expression, but this view obscures the true role of the proteome as part of the
final link that connects the genome with the biochemistry of the cell (Figure
6.22). Exploring the nature of this link is proving to be one of the most exciting and productive aspects of modern biology.

6.3.1 The metabolome
Often in biology the most important steps forward do not result from some
groundbreaking experiment but instead arise because biologists devise a
new way of thinking about a problem. The introduction of the concept of the
metabolome is an example. The metabolome is defined as the complete collection of metabolites present in a cell or tissue under a particular set of conditions. In other words, a metabolome is a biochemical blueprint, and its
study, which is called metabolomics or biochemical profiling, gives a precise description of the biochemistry underlying different physiological
states, including disease states, that can be adopted by a cell or tissue. By
converting the biochemistry of a cell into an itemized set of metabolites,
metabolomics provides a dataset that can be directly linked to the equivalent, itemized information which emerges from proteomics and other studies of genome expression.
A metabolome can be characterized by chemical techniques such as infrared
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy which, individually and in combination, can identify and quantify

Chapter 6 Understanding How a Genome Functions

the various small molecules that make up the metabolites in a cell. When
these data are combined with knowledge about the reaction rates for the various steps in well-characterized biochemical pathways such as glycolysis and
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, it is possible to model the metabolic flux,
the rate of flow of metabolites through the network of pathways that make up
the cellular biochemistry. Changes in the metabolome can then be defined in
terms of perturbations in the flux of metabolites through one or more parts of
the network, providing a very sophisticated description of the biochemical
basis to changes in the physiological state. This leads to the possibility of
metabolic engineering, in which changes are made to the genome by mutation or recombinant DNA techniques in order to influence the cellular biochemistry in a predetermined way, for example to increase the synthesis of an
antibiotic by a microorganism.
At present, metabolomics is most advanced with organisms such as bacteria
and yeast whose biochemistries are relatively simple. Considerable research
is currently being directed toward the human metabolome, with the objective
of describing the metabolic profiles of healthy tissues, of disease states, and
of tissues in patients undergoing drug treatments. It is hoped that when these
studies reach maturity it will be possible to use the metabolic information to
design drugs that reverse or mitigate the particular flux abnormalities that
occur in the disease state. Biochemical profiling could also indicate any
unwanted side effects of drug treatment, enabling modifications to be made
to the chemical structure of the drug, or to its mode of use, so that these side
effects are minimized.

6.3.2 Understanding biological systems
The emphasis that is now placed on protein interaction maps and
metabolomics leads us to the final aspect of genome function that we must
consider. This is the need to describe and understand the expression of a
genome not in terms of the molecules—RNAs, proteins, and metabolites—
whose synthesis the genome directs, but in terms of the biological systems
that result from coordinated activity of those molecules. This is the essence of
the leap that has been made in recent years from genes to genomes. One of
the underlying principles of the pregenome era of molecular biology was the
“one gene, one enzyme” hypothesis first put forward by George Beadle and
Edward Tatum in the 1940s. By “one gene, one enzyme”, Beadle and Tatum
were emphasizing that a single gene codes for a single protein which, if an
enzyme, directs a single biochemical reaction. The trpC gene of Escherichia
coli, for example, codes for the enzyme indole-3-glycerol phosphate synthase, which converts 1-(o-carboxyphenylamino)-1¢-deoxyribulose-5¢-phosphate into indole-3-glycerol phosphate. However, this enzyme does not work
in isolation: its activity forms part of the biochemical pathway which results
in synthesis of tryptophan, the other enzymes in this pathway being specified
by the genes trpA, B, D, and E, which together with trpC form the tryptophan
operon of E. coli (see Figure 8.8B). The tryptophan biosynthesis pathway is
therefore a simple biological system and the tryptophan operon is the set of
genes that specify that pathway. But simply transcribing and translating the
genes in the operon will not lead to the synthesis of tryptophan. Successful
operation of the system requires that the biosynthetic enzymes be present at
the appropriate place in the cell, in the appropriate relative amounts, at the
appropriate time. The system is therefore dependent on factors such as the
rate of synthesis of the proteins coded by the genes, the correct folding of

these proteins into the functional enzymes, the rate of degradation of the
enzyme molecules, their localization in the cell, and the presence of the necessary amounts of the metabolites that act as substrates and cofactors for
tryptophan synthesis. This simple biological system is starting to assume
quite considerable complexity. And yet, with this system we are considering
only 5 of the 4405 genes in the E. coli genome.
To date, progress in systems biology has been made in a number of areas,
including understanding the biological system responsible for synthesis of
the E. coli flagellum. Pregenome studies had shown that flagellar synthesis
requires 51 genes organized into 12 operons, which are activated in three
groups (Figure 6.23). The first group to be activated comprises a single operon
containing two genes which code for a protein that acts as a master regulator,
switching on expression of the second group of seven operons, whose genes
together specify components of the basal structure of the flagellum. One of
these genes codes for a second regulatory protein that switches on the
remaining four operons, which direct synthesis of the flagellum filament and
the biochemical system that enables the bacterium to respond to chemical
stimuli by rotating its flagellum in order to swim towards an attractant.
Careful use of reporter genes attached to individual operons has revealed the
precise order in which the operons in each group are activated, and has
enabled activation coefficients—measures of the relative rates of expression—to be assigned to each operon. The resulting information is sufficient
for the system to be modeled on a computer, enabling the detailed roles of
the two regulatory proteins to be determined. From the computer models,
the effects of subtle changes to the system (such as a change in the properties
of one of the regulators) can be predicted and then tested by further experiments with the biological system. This is precisely the type of research that we
hope one day to be able to carry out with human cells, in order to understand
the exact basis to abnormalities and hopefully to design ways of returning a
diseased tissue to its normal state. Scaling-up to these much larger biological

systems, with the grand objective of one day understanding how a bacterial
or eukaryotic cell works, will test the ingenuity and resourcefulness of biologists for decades to come. The first step has, however, been made with the
change in emphasis from the functioning of individual genes to the functioning of entire genomes, and by the establishment of techniques for studying
transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes, which together form the
components of these biological systems.

Summary
The major challenge of postgenomics is to understand how the genome specifies and coordinates the various biochemical activities that take place within
a living cell. Central to this work are studies of the transcriptome and proteome that are synthesized and maintained by the genome. Although transcriptomes can be studied by cDNA sequencing, including use of techniques
such as SAGE which provides minisequences from many cDNAs in a single
experiment, the most important advances are being made through use of
microarray and chip technology. Hybridization of differentially labeled
cDNAs prepared from two or more transcriptomes to a microarray or chip
gives information on gene expression patterns, which can be analyzed by
hierarchical clustering to reveal functional relationships between genes.
Transcriptome studies are helping us to understand the genetic basis to
developmental pathways and to human diseases including several types of
cancer. Proteome studies are equally important because examination of a
transcriptome only reveals which genes are expressed in a particular cell, and
does not give an accurate picture of the proteins that are present. Protein profiling uses two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI-TOF of
isolated peptide fragments to characterize the proteins in a proteome. To
understand how a proteome operates within a cell it is useful to know which
proteins interact with one another. Phage display and the yeast two-hybrid
system are the most frequently used methods for identifying pairs of proteins
that form physical associations, and methods such as coimmunoprecipitation can be used to isolate intact multiprotein complexes. Functional interactions, which do not always require that a pair of proteins make physical contact, can be deduced by comparative genomics, analyses of gene expression
profiles, and by gene inactivation studies. The resulting information enables
protein interaction maps to be constructed, showing all the interactions
occurring in a single proteome. These maps are typically structured around a
relatively small number of proteins that have many interactions and form
hubs in the network, some hubs representing individual biological processes
and others linking biological processes to one another. The proteome maintains the metabolome—the complete collection of metabolites present in a
cell or tissue—and it is anticipated that metabolome studies will reveal the
precise biochemical basis to disease states and to unwanted side effects of
drug treatment. Work with transcriptomes, proteomes, and metabolomes is
leading biologists towards systems biology, in which attempts are made to
understand the expression of a genome not in terms of the molecules whose
synthesis the genome directs, but in terms of the biological systems that
result from coordinated activity of those molecules.

PART

Genome Anatomies

Part 2 – Genome Anatomies surveys the information on genome organization that has been
revealed, mostly during the last ten years, through
use of the techniques described in Part 1.
Chapter 7 examines eukaryotic nuclear genomes,
with emphasis on the human genome which, as
well as being our own genome, is the most complex genome so far sequenced. Chapter 8 investigates the genomes of prokaryotes and eukaryotic
organelles, the latter dealt with here because of
their prokaryotic origins. Chapter 9 looks at virus
genomes and mobile genetic elements, grouped
together because some mobile elements are
related to virus genomes.

7.1 Nuclear Genomes are Contained
in Chromosomes
7.2 The Genetic Features of Eukaryotic
Nuclear Genomes

When you have read Chapter 7, you should be able to:
Describe the DNA–protein interactions that give rise to nucleosomes, chromatosomes, and the
30 nm chromatin fiber.
State the functions of centromeres and telomeres and describe the specific DNA–protein
interactions that occur within these structures.
Explain why chromosome banding patterns and the isochore model suggest that genes are not
evenly distributed in eukaryotic chromosomes.
Compare the organization of genes in various eukaryotic nuclear genomes and discuss the
relationship between gene organization and genome size.
Summarize the overall content of the human genome.
Describe different ways of categorizing the functions of eukaryotic genes, and outline the important
features revealed by comparisons of gene catalogs for different eukaryotes.
Explain, with examples, what is meant by “multigene family.”
Distinguish between conventional and processed pseudogenes and other types of evolutionary relic.
Distinguish between tandemly repeated DNA and interspersed repetitive DNA, and describe the
important features of satellite, minisatellite, and microsatellite DNA.

In the next three chapters we will survey the anatomies of the various types of
genome that are found on our planet. There are three chapters because there
are three types of genome to consider:
G

Eukaryotic nuclear genomes (this chapter), of which the human genome
is the one of greatest interest to us.

G

The genomes of prokaryotes and of eukaryotic organelles (Chapter 8),
which we will consider together because eukaryotic organelles are descended from ancient prokaryotes.

G

Virus genomes and mobile genetic elements (Chapter 9), grouped
together because some mobile elements are related to virus genomes.

Chapter 7 Eukaryotic Nuclear Genomes

7.1 Nuclear Genomes are Contained in
Chromosomes
The nuclear genome is split into a set of linear DNA molecules, each contained in a chromosome. No exceptions to this pattern are known: all eukaryotes that have been studied have at least two chromosomes and the DNA
molecules are always linear. The only variability at this level of eukaryotic
genome structure lies with chromosome number, which appears to be unrelated to the biological features of the organism. For example, yeast has 16
chromosomes, four times as many as the fruit fly. Nor is chromosome number linked to genome size: some salamanders have genomes 30 times bigger
than the human version but split into half the number of chromosomes.
These comparisons are interesting but at present do not tell us anything useful about the genomes themselves; they are more a reflection of the nonuniformity of the evolutionary events that have shaped genome architecture in
different organisms.

7.1.1 Packaging of DNA into chromosomes
Chromosomes are much shorter than the DNA molecules that they contain:
the average human chromosome has just under 5 cm of DNA. A highly organized packaging system is therefore needed to fit a DNA molecule into its chromosome. We must understand this packaging system before we start to think
about how genomes function because the nature of the packaging has an
influence on the processes involved in expression of individual genes
(Chapter 10).
The important breakthroughs in understanding DNA packaging were made
in the early 1970s by a combination of biochemical analysis and electron
microscopy. It was already known that nuclear DNA is associated with DNAbinding proteins called histones but the exact nature of the association had
not been delineated. In 1973–1974, several groups carried out nuclease

Chromatin is gently purified from nuclei and
treated with a nuclease enzyme. On the left,
the nuclease treatment is carried out under
limiting conditions so that the DNA is cut,
on average, just once in each of the linker
regions between the bound proteins. After
removal of the protein, the DNA fragments
are analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis
and found to be 200 bp in length, or
multiples thereof. On the right, the nuclease
treatment proceeds to completion, so all
the DNA in the linker regions is digested.
The remaining DNA fragments are all 146
bp in length. The results show that in this
form of chromatin, protein complexes are
spaced along the DNA at regular intervals,
one for each 200 bp, with 146 bp of DNA
closely attached to each protein complex.

Nuclear Genomes are Contained in Chromosomes

protection experiments on chromatin (DNA–histone complexes) that had
been gently extracted from nuclei by methods designed to retain as much of
the chromatin structure as possible. In a nuclease protection experiment
the complex is treated with an enzyme that cuts the DNA at positions that
are not “protected” by attachment to a protein. The sizes of the resulting
DNA fragments indicate the positioning of the protein complexes on the
original DNA molecule (Figure 7.1). After limited nuclease treatment of
purified chromatin, the bulk of the DNA fragments have lengths of approximately 200 bp and multiples thereof, suggesting a regular spacing of histone proteins along the DNA.

DNA

Nucleosomes

In 1974 these biochemical results were supplemented by electron micrographs
of purified chromatin, which enabled the regular spacing inferred by the protection experiments to be visualized as beads of protein on the string of DNA
(Figure 7.2A). Further biochemical analysis indicated that each bead, or nucleosome, contains eight histone protein molecules, these being two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Structural studies have shown that these eight
proteins form a barrel-shaped core octamer with the DNA wound twice
around the outside (Figure 7.2B). Between 140 bp and 150 bp of DNA (depending on the species) are associated with the nucleosome particle, and each
nucleosome is separated by 50–70 bp of linker DNA, giving the repeat length of
190–220 bp previously shown by the nuclease protection experiments.
As well as the proteins of the core octamer, there is a group of additional histones, all closely related to one another and collectively called linker histones. In vertebrates these include histones H1a–e, H10, H1t, and H5. A single linker histone is attached to each nucleosome, to form the chromatosome, but the precise positioning of this linker histone is not known.
Structural studies support the traditional model in which the linker histone
acts as a clamp, preventing the coiled DNA from detaching from the nucleosome (Figure 7.2C). However, other results suggest that, at least in some
organisms, the linker histone is not located on the extreme surface of the
nucleosome–DNA assembly, as would be expected if it really were a clamp,
but instead is inserted between the core octamer and the DNA.
The “beads-on-a-string” structure shown in Figure 7.2A is thought to represent an unpacked form of chromatin that occurs only infrequently in living
nuclei. Very gentle cell-breakage techniques developed in the mid-1970s
resulted in the finding of a more condensed version of the complex, called the
30 nm fiber (it is approximately 30 nm in width). The exact way in which
nucleosomes associate to form the 30 nm fiber is not known, but several
models have been proposed, two of which are shown in Figure 7.3. The individual nucleosomes within the 30 nm fiber may be held together by interactions between the linker histones, or the attachments may involve the core
histones, whose protein “tails” extend outside the nucleosome (see Figure
10.13). The latter hypothesis is attractive because chemical modification of
these tails results in the 30 nm fiber opening up, enabling genes contained
within it to be activated (Section 10.2.1).

7.1.2 The special features of metaphase chromosomes
The 30 nm fiber is probably the major type of chromatin in the nucleus during interphase, the period between nuclear divisions. When the nucleus
divides, the DNA adopts a more compact form of packaging, resulting in the

(B) The model for the “beads-on-a-string”
structure, in which each bead is a barrelshaped nucleosome with the DNA wound
twice around the outside. Each nucleosome
is made up of eight proteins: a central
tetramer of two histone H3 and two histone
H4 subunits, plus a pair of H2A–H2B
dimers, one above and one below the
central tetramer (see Figure 10.13). (C) The
precise position of the linker histone relative
to the nucleosome is not known but, as
shown here, the linker histone may act as a
clamp, preventing the DNA from detaching
from the outside of the nucleosome. Image

highly condensed metaphase chromosomes that can be seen with the light
microscope and which have the appearance generally associated with the
word “chromosome” (Figure 7.4). The metaphase chromosomes form at a
stage in the cell cycle after DNA replication has taken place, and so each
one contains two copies of its chromosomal DNA molecule. The two copies
are held together at the centromere, which has a specific position within
each chromosome. The arms of the chromosome, which are called chromatids and have terminal structures called telomeres, are of different
lengths in different chromosomes. Individual chromosomes can therefore
be recognized because of the lengths of their chromatids and the location
of the centromere relative to the telomeres. Further distinguishing features
are revealed when chromosomes are stained. There are a number of different staining techniques (Table 7.1), each resulting in a banding pattern that
is characteristic for a particular chromosome. This means that the set of

Figure 7.6 The Saccharomyces cerevisiae
centromere. CDEI is 9 bp in length, CDEII
is 80–90 bp, and CDEIII is 11 bp. Additional
sequences flanking the region shown here
are looked on as part of the centromeric
DNA, whose full length is approximately
125 bp.

The human karyogram is typical of that of the great majority of eukaryotes,
but some organisms display unusual features not displayed by the human
version. These include the following:
G

Minichromosomes are relatively short in length but rich in genes. The
chicken genome, for example, is split into 39 chromosomes: six
macrochromosomes containing 66% of the DNA but only 25% of the
genes, and 33 minichromosomes containing the remaining one-third of the
genome and 75% of the genes. The gene density in the minichromosomes
is therefore some six times greater than that in the macrochromosomes.

G

B chromosomes are additional chromosomes possessed by some individuals in a population, but not all. They are common in plants and also
known in fungi, insects, and animals. B chromosomes appear to be fragmentary versions of normal chromosomes that result from unusual
events during nuclear division. Some contain genes, often for rRNAs, but
it is not clear if these genes are active. The presence of B chromosomes
can affect the biological characteristics of the organism, particularly in
plants where they are associated with reduced viability. It is presumed that
B chromosomes are gradually lost from cell lineages as a result of irregularities in their inheritance pattern.

G

Holocentric chromosomes do not have a single centromere but instead
have multiple structures spread along their length. The nematode worm
Caenorhabditis elegans has holocentric chromosomes.

Figure 7.8 The role of the kinetochores
during nuclear division. During the
anaphase period of nuclear division,
individual chromosomes are drawn apart by
the contraction of microtubules attached to
the kinetochores.

The DNA contained within centromeres and telomeres, and the proteins
attached to this DNA, have special features related to the particular functions
of these structures.
The nucleotide sequence of centromeric DNA in higher eukaryotes is best
understood in the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, whose amenity to genetic
analysis has enabled the positions of the centromeres on the DNA sequence
to be located with some precision. Also, a special effort was made to
sequence these centromeric regions, which are sometimes excluded from
genome sequences because of problems in obtaining an accurate reading
through the highly repetitive structures that characterize these regions.
Arabidopsis centromeres span 0.9–1.2 Mb of DNA and each one is made up
largely of 180 bp repeat sequences. In humans the equivalent sequences are
171 bp in length and are called alphoid DNA, with 1500–30,000 copies per
centromere. Before the Arabidopsis sequences were obtained it was thought
that these repeat sequences were by far the principal component of centromeric DNA. However, Arabidopsis centromeres also contain multiple
copies of genome-wide repeats, along with a few genes, the latter at a density
of 7–9 per 100 kb compared with 25 genes per 100 kb for the noncentromeric
regions of Arabidopsis chromosomes. The discovery that centromeric DNA
contains genes was a big surprise because it was thought that these regions
were genetically inactive.
Arabidopsis and humans display the basic pattern for centromeric DNA as
seen in virtually all eukaryotes, but an interesting variation occurs in the yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose centromere is defined by a single sequence,
approximately 125 bp in length. This sequence is made up of two short elements, called CDEI and CDEIII, which flank a longer element called CDEII

(Figure 7.6). The sequence of CDEII is variable, though always very rich in A
and T nucleotides, whereas both CDEI and CDEIII are highly conserved,
meaning that their sequences are very similar in all 16 yeast chromosomes.
Mutations in CDEII rarely affect the function of the centromere, but a mutation in CDEI or CDEIII usually prevents the centromere from forming. The
short, nonrepetitive nature of the yeast centromeric DNA has enabled
progress to be made in understanding how the DNA interacts with proteins to
form a functional centromere. A key role is played by a special chromosomal
protein called Cse4, which is similar in structure to histone H3 and which,
with a second protein called Mif2, forms a core around which the CDEII
sequence is wrapped (Figure 7.7). The DNA appears to be held in place by two
further proteins: Cbf1, which recognizes and attaches to the CDEI sequence,
and Cbf3 (in fact a tetramer of four proteins), which attaches to CDEIII. Cbf1
and Cbf3 also bind to at least some of the 20 or so additional proteins that
form the kinetochore, the structure that acts as the attachment point for the
microtubules which draw the divided chromosomes into the daughter nuclei
(Figure 7.8). To what extent this model of the yeast centromere also applies to
other eukaryotes is not yet clear. The centromeres of higher eukaryotes are
quite different as they contain nucleosomes, similar to those in other regions
of the chromosome but some of them containing the protein CENP-A instead
of histone H3. CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are more compact and
structurally rigid than those containing H3, and it has been suggested that the
arrangement of CENP-A and H3 nucleosomes along the DNA is such that the
CENP-A versions are located on the surface of the centromere, where they
form an outer shell on which the kinetochore is constructed (Figure 7.9).
The second important part of the chromosome is the terminal region or
telomere. Telomeres are important because they mark the ends of chromosomes and therefore enable the cell to distinguish a real end from an unnatural end caused by chromosome breakage—an essential requirement
because the cell must repair the latter but not the former. Telomeric DNA is
made up of hundreds of copies of a repeated motif, 5¢–TTAGGG–3¢ in
humans, with a short extension of the 3¢ terminus of the double-stranded
DNA molecule (Figure 7.10). Two special proteins bind to the repeat
sequences in human telomeres. These are called TRF1, which helps to regulate the length of the telomere, and TRF2, which maintains the single-strand
extension. If TRF2 is inactivated then this extension is lost and the two
polynucleotides fuse together in a covalent linkage. Other telomeric proteins
are thought to form a linkage between the telomere and the periphery of the
nucleus, the area in which the chromosome ends are localized. Further proteins mediate the enzymatic activity that maintains the length of each telomere during DNA replication. We will return to this last activity in Section
15.2.4: it is critical to the survival of the chromosome and may be a key to
understanding cell senescence and death.

7.2 The Genetic Features of Eukaryotic
Nuclear Genomes
In Chapter 5 we examined the range of bioinformatic and experimental
methods that can be used to locate the genes in a genome sequence and to
determine their functions. Now we turn our attention to what those methods
have told us about the genetic features of eukaryotic nuclear genomes.

Low density

7.2.1 Where are the genes in a nuclear genome?
In the previous section we learnt that Arabidopsis centromeres contain genes
but at a lesser density than that in the rest of the chromosomes. This alerts us
to the fact that the genes are not arranged evenly along the length of a chromosome. In most organisms, genes appear to be distributed more at less at
random, with substantial variations in gene density at different positions
within a chromosome. The average gene density in Arabidopsis is 25 genes
per 100 kb, but even outside of the centromeres and telomeres the density
varies from 1 to 38 genes per 100 kb, as illustrated in Figure 7.11 for the largest
of the plant’s five chromosomes. The same is true for human chromosomes,
where the density ranges from 0 to 64 genes per 100 kb.
The uneven gene distribution within human chromosomes was suspected
for several years before the sequence was completed. There were two lines of
evidence, one of which related to the banding patterns that are produced
when chromosomes are stained. The dyes used in these procedures (see
Table 7.1) bind to DNA molecules, but in most cases with preferences for certain base pairs. Giemsa, for example, has a greater affinity for DNA regions
that are rich in A and T nucleotides. The dark G-bands in the human karyogram (see Figure 7.5) are therefore thought to be AT-rich regions of the
genome. The base composition of the genome as a whole is 59.7% A + T so
the dark G-bands must have AT contents substantially greater than 60%.
Cytogeneticists therefore predicted that there would be fewer genes in dark
G-bands because genes generally have AT contents of 45%–50%. This prediction was confirmed when the genome sequence was compared with the
human karyogram.
The second line of evidence pointing to uneven gene distribution derived
from the isochore model of genome organization. According to this model,
the genomes of vertebrates and plants (and possibly of other eukaryotes) are
mosaics of segments of DNA, each at least 300 kb in length, with each segment having a uniform base composition that differs from that of the adjacent segments. Support for the isochore model comes from experiments in
which genomic DNA is broken into fragments of approximately 100 kb,
treated with dyes that bind specifically to AT- or GC-rich regions, and the
pieces separated by density gradient centrifugation (Technical Note 7.1).
When this experiment is carried out with human DNA, five fractions are
seen, each representing a different isochore type with a distinctive base
composition: two AT-rich isochores, called L1 and L2, and three GC-rich
classes called H1, H2, and H3. The last of these, H3, is the least abundant in
the human genome, making up only 3% of the total, but contains over 25%
of the genes. This is a clear indication that genes are not distributed evenly
through the human genome. In fact, examination of the genome sequence
suggests that the isochore theory oversimplifies what is, in reality, a much

Technical Note 7.1 Ultracentrifugation techniques
Methodology for separation of cell components and large molecules
The development of high-speed centrifuges in the 1920s
led to techniques for separating organelles and other fractions from disrupted cells. The first technique to be used
was differential centrifugation, in which pellets of successively lighter cell components are collected by centrifuging
cell extracts at different speeds. Intact nuclei, for example,
are relatively large and can be collected from a cell extract
by centrifugation at 1000 g for 10 minutes; mitochondria,
being lighter, require centrifugation at 20,000 g for 20
minutes. Different cell components can be obtained in
fairly pure form by careful manipulation of the centrifugation parameters.
Density gradient centrifugation was used for the first time
in 1951. In this procedure, the cell fraction is not centrifuged in a normal aqueous solution. Instead, a sucrose
solution is layered into the tube in such a way that a density gradient is formed, the solution being more concentrated and hence denser toward the bottom of the tube.
The cell fraction is placed on the top of the gradient and the
tube centrifuged at a very high speed: at least 500,000 g
for several hours. Under these conditions, the rate of migration of a cell component through the gradient depends on

its sedimentation coefficient, which in turn depends on its
molecular mass and shape. For example, eukaryotic ribosomes have a sedimentation coefficient of 80S (S stands
for Svedberg units, Svedberg being the Swedish scientist
who pioneered the biological applications of ultracentrifugation), whereas bacterial ribosomes, being smaller, have a
sedimentation coefficient of 70S.
In a second type of density gradient centrifugation, a solution such as 8 M cesium chloride is used, which is substantially denser than the sucrose solution used to measure S
values. The starting solution is uniform, the gradient being
established during the centrifugation. Cellular components
migrate down through the centrifuge tube, but molecules
such as DNA and proteins do not reach the bottom; instead
each one comes to rest at a position where the density of
the matrix equals its own buoyant density (see Figure
7.23). This technique has many applications in molecular
biology, being able to separate DNA fragments of different
base compositions and DNA molecules with different conformations (e.g., supercoiled, circular, and linear DNA). It
can also distinguish between normal DNA and DNA labeled
with a heavy isotope of nitrogen (Section 15.1.1).

more complex pattern of variations in base composition along the length of
each human chromosome. But even if it turns out to be a misconception, the
isochore theory will have been a useful misconception as it played an important role in helping molecular biologists of the presequence era to understand genome structure.

7.2.2 How are the genes organized in a nuclear genome?
The variations in gene density that occur along the length of a eukaryotic
chromosome mean that it is difficult to identify regions in which the organization of the genes can be looked on as “typical” of the genome as a whole.
Despite this difficulty, it is clear that the overall pattern of gene organization
varies greatly between different eukaryotes, and we need to understand these
differences because they reflect important distinctions between the genetic
features and evolutionary histories of these genomes. In order to illustrate the
differences we will, in this section, look in detail at a small part of the human
genome and compare this segment with equally small parts of the genomes
of other organisms. As you work through this material you should focus on
the distinctive features that are being drawn out, but remember that the variations that occur along a single chromosome mean that it is impossible to
make hard and fast statements about the patterns of gene organization that
are present in, or absent from, a particular genome.

The genes make up only a small part of the human genome
How are genes organized in the human nuclear genome? To answer this question we will examine a 50 kb segment of chromosome 12 (Figure 7.12). This
segment contains the following genetic features:
G

Four genes. These are:
•

PKP2, which codes for plakophilin 2, a protein involved in synthesis of
desmosomes, structures that act as connection points between adjacent mammalian cells.

•

SYB1, specifying a vesicle-associated membrane protein whose role is
to ensure that vesicles fuse with their correct target membranes within
the cell.

•

A gene whose function has not yet been identified, called FLJ10143.

•

CD27, coding for a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, a group of proteins that regulate signal transduction pathways
involved in apoptosis (programmed cell death) and cell differentiation.

Note that each of these four genes is discontinuous, the number of introns
ranging from two for SYB1 to eight for PKP2.

genes, gene segments, genome-wide

88 genome-wide repeat sequences. These are sequences that recur at
many places in the genome. There are four main types of genome-wide
repeat, called LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements), SINEs (short
interspersed nuclear elements), LTR (long terminal repeat) elements, and
DNA transposons. Examples of each type are seen in this short segment of

the genome. Most of the genome-wide repeats are located in the intergenic regions but several lie within introns.
G

Seven microsatellites, which as described in Section 3.2.2, are sequences
in which a short motif is repeated in tandem. One of the microsatellites
seen here has the motif CA repeated 12 times, giving the sequence:
5¢–CACACACACACACACACACACACA–3¢
3¢–GTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGT–5¢
The other six microsatellites comprise repeats of CAAA, CCTG, CTGGGG,
CAAAA, TG, and TTTG, respectively. Four of the seven microsatellites are
located within introns.

G

Finally, approximately 30% of our 50 kb segment of the human genome is
made up of stretches of nongenic, nonrepetitive, single-copy DNA of no
known function or significance.

The most striking feature of this 50 kb segment of the human genome is the
relatively small amount of space taken up by the genes. When added together,
the total length of the exons—the parts of the four genes that contain the biological information—is 4745 bp, equivalent to 9.5% of the 50 kb segment. In
fact, this segment is rather rich in genes: all the exons in the human genome
make up only 48 Mb, just 1.5% of the total. In contrast, 44% of the genome is
taken up by genome-wide repeats (Figure 7.13).

The yeast genome is very compact
How extensive are the differences in gene organization among eukaryotes?
There are certainly very substantial differences in genome size, with the smallest eukaryotic genomes less than 10 Mb in length, and the largest over 100,000
Mb. As can be seen in Figure 7.14 and Table 7.2, this size range coincides to a
certain extent with the complexity of the organism, the simplest eukaryotes
such as fungi having the smallest genomes, and higher eukaryotes such as vertebrates and flowering plants having the largest ones. This might appear to
make sense, as one would expect the complexity of an organism to be related
to the number of genes in its genome—higher eukaryotes need larger

from precise: if it was, then the nuclear genome of the yeast Saccharomyces

genome, would be expected to contain 0.004 ¥ 35,000 genes, which is just 140.
In fact the S. cerevisiae genome contains about 6000 genes.

For many years the lack of precise correlation between the complexity of an
organism and the size of its genome was looked on as a bit of a puzzle, the socalled C-value paradox. In fact the answer is quite simple: space is saved in the
genomes of less-complex organisms because the genes are more closely packed
together. The S. cerevisiae genome illustrates this point, as we can see from the
top two parts of Figure 7.15, where the 50 kb segment of the human genome that
we have just examined is compared with a 50 kb segment of the yeast genome.
The yeast genome segment, which comes from chromosome III (the first eukaryotic chromosome to be sequenced), has the following distinctive features:
G

It contains more genes than the human segment. This region of yeast
chromosome III contains 26 genes thought to code for proteins and two
that code for transfer RNAs.

G

Relatively few of the yeast genes are discontinuous. In this segment of
chromosome III none of the genes are discontinuous. In the entire yeast
genome there are only 239 introns, compared with over 300,000 in the
human genome.

G

There are fewer genome-wide repeats. This part of chromosome III contains
a single LTR element, called Ty2, and four truncated LTR elements called
delta sequences. These five genome-wide repeats make up 13.5% of the
50 kb segment, but this figure is not typical of the yeast genome as a whole.
When all 16 yeast chromosomes are considered, the total amount of
sequence taken up by genome-wide repeats is only 3.4% of the total.

are more compact, having fewer introns, and the spaces between the genes are
relatively short, with much less space taken up by genome-wide repeats and
other noncoding sequences.

Gene organization in other eukaryotes
The hypothesis that more complex eukaryotes have less compact genomes
holds when other species are examined. The third part of Figure 7.15 shows a
50 kb segment of the fruit-fly genome. If we agree that a fruit fly is more complex than a yeast cell but less complex than a human then we would expect
the organization of the fruit-fly genome to be intermediate between that of
yeast and humans. This is what we see in Figure 7.15C, this 50 kb segment of
the fruit-fly genome having 11 genes, more than in the human segment but
fewer than in the yeast sequence. All of these genes are discontinuous, but
seven have just one intron each. The picture is similar when the entire
genome sequences of the three organisms are compared (Table 7.3). The gene
density in the fruit-fly genome is intermediate between that of yeast and
humans, and the average fruit-fly gene has many more introns than the average yeast gene but still three times fewer than the average human gene.
The comparison between the yeast, fruit-fly, and human genomes also holds
true when we consider the genome-wide repeats (see Table 7.3). These make
up 3.4% of the yeast genome, about 12% of the fruit-fly genome, and 44% of
the human genome. It is beginning to become clear that the genome-wide
repeats play an intriguing role in dictating the compactness or otherwise of a
genome. This is strikingly illustrated by the maize genome, which at 2500 Mb
is relatively small for a flowering plant. Only a few regions of the maize
genome have been sequenced, but some remarkable results have been
obtained, revealing a genome dominated by repetitive elements. Figure 7.15D
shows a 50 kb segment of this genome, either side of one member of a family
of genes coding for the alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes. This is the only gene
in this 50 kb region, although there is a second one, of unknown function,
approximately 100 kb beyond the right-hand end of the sequence shown
here. Instead of genes, the dominant feature of this genome segment is the
genome-wide repeats, which have been described as forming a sea within
which islands of genes are located. The genome-wide repeats are of the LTR
element type, which comprise virtually all of the noncoding part of the segment, and on their own are estimated to make up approximately 50% of the
maize genome. It is becoming clear that one or more families of genomewide repeats have undergone a massive proliferation in the genomes of certain species. This may provide an explanation for the most puzzling aspect of
the C-value paradox, which is not the general increase in genome size that is
seen in increasingly complex organisms, but the fact that similar organisms

can differ greatly in genome size. A good example is provided by Amoeba
dubia which, being a protozoan, might be expected to have a genome of
100–500 kb, similar to other protozoa such as Tetrahymena pyriformis (see
Table 7.2). In fact the Amoeba genome is over 200,000 Mb. Similarly, we might
guess that the genomes of crickets would be similar in size to those of other
insects, but these bugs have genomes of approximately 2000 Mb, 11 times
that of the fruit fly.

7.2.3 How many genes are there and what are
their functions?
The most detailed annotations of the finished human chromosome
sequences suggest that the human genome contains 30,000–40,000 genes, the
uncertainty arising because of the difficulty, outlined in Section 5.1.1, in recognizing which sequences are genes and which are not. The number is much
lower than originally expected, as a “best guess” of 80,000–100,000 was still in
vogue up to a few months before the draft sequences were completed in 2000.
These early estimates were high because they were based on the supposition
that, in most cases, a single gene specifies a single mRNA and a single protein.
According to this model, the number of genes in the human genome should
be similar to the number of proteins in human cells, leading to the estimates
of 80,000–100,000. The discovery that the number of genes is much lower
than this indicates that alternative splicing, the process by which exons from
a pre-mRNA are assembled in different combinations so that more than one
protein can be coded by a single gene (see Figure 6.5), is more prevalent than
was originally appreciated. Gene numbers for a variety of eukaryotic nuclear
genomes are given in Table 7.4, but you should bear in mind that because of
alternative splicing the question “How many genes are there?” has no real
biological significance, as the number of genes does not indicate the number
of proteins that can be synthesized and hence is not a measure of the biological complexity of a genome.
Although alternative splicing enables one gene to specify several proteins,
those proteins will have at least some parts of their amino acid sequences in
common and so will usually have similar or related functions. Categorizing
genes according to their functions can therefore give meaningful information

on the range of biochemical activities specified by a genome, even if for many
genes the splicing variants have either not been identified or not assigned
individual functions. With gene catalogs the problem is lack of completeness,
because of the difficulties in identifying functions, even for a relatively simple
organism such as Saccharomyces cerevisae. It is quite probable that certain
categories of gene are underrepresented in the existing catalogs, because
those genes have functions that are particularly difficult to identify. With
these qualifications in mind we will first look at the human gene catalog.

The human gene catalog
The functions of over half of the 30,000–40,000 human genes are known or
can be inferred with a reasonable degree of certainty. The vast majority code
for proteins; less than 2500 specify the various types of functional RNA.
Almost one-quarter of the protein-coding genes are involved in expression,
replication, and maintenance of the genome (Figure 7.16) and another 21%
specify components of the signal transduction pathways that regulate
genome expression and other cellular activities in response to signals
received from outside the cell (Section 14.1.2). All of these genes can be
looked on as having a function that is involved in one way or another with the
activity of the genome. Enzymes responsible for the general biochemical
functions of the cell account for another 17.5% of the known genes, and the
remainder are involved in activities such as transport of compounds into and
out of cells, the folding of proteins into their correct three-dimensional structures, the immune response, and synthesis of structural proteins such as
those found in the cytoskeleton and in muscles. It is possible that as the
human gene catalog is made more complete, the relative proportions of the
genes in the three major categories in Figure 7.16 will decrease. This is
because these major categories represent the most studied areas of cell biology, which means that many of the relevant genes can be recognized because
their protein products are known. Genes whose products have not yet been
identified are more likely to be involved in the less-well-studied areas of
cellular activity.

13,000 genes whose functions are not yet
known. The segment labeled “various other
activities” includes, among others, proteins
involved in biochemical transport processes
and protein folding, immunological proteins,
and structural proteins.

One thing that the gene catalog cannot tell us, and will not be able to tell us
even when it is complete, is what makes a human being. The minimalist
approach to molecular biology, whereby the study of individual genes or
groups of genes is expected to lead eventually to a full, biomolecular description of how a human being is constructed and functions, has been dealt a
severe blow by the human genome sequence. There are no amazing revelations about what makes humans different from apes. Even though the chimpanzee genome has been completely sequenced it is still not possible simply
from genome comparisons to determine what makes us human (Section
18.4). On the basis of gene number we are only three times more complex than
a fruit fly and only twice as complex as the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis
elegans. More detailed studies of how the human genome functions may
reveal key features that underlie some of the special attributes of human
beings, but genomics will never explain humanity.

Gene catalogs reveal the distinctive features of different organisms
There are various ways to categorize the genes in a eukaryotic genome. One
possibility is to classify the genes according to their function, as shown in
Figure 7.16 for the human genome. This system has the advantage that the
fairly broad functional categories used in Figure 7.16 can be further subdivided

Genomes Chapter 7

Page 213

to produce a hierarchy of increasingly specific descriptions for smaller and
smaller sets of genes. The weakness with this approach is that functions have
not yet been assigned to many eukaryotic genes, so this type of classification
leaves out a proportion of the total gene set. A more powerful method is to
base the classification not on the functions of genes but on the structures of
the proteins that they specify. A protein molecule is constructed from a series
of domains, each of which has a particular biochemical function. Examples
are the zinc finger, which is one of several domains that enable a protein to
bind to a DNA molecule (Section 11.1.1), and the “death domain,” which is
present in many proteins involved in apoptosis. Each domain has a characteristic amino acid sequence, perhaps not exactly the same sequence in every
example of that domain, but close enough for the presence of a particular
domain to be recognizable by examining the amino acid sequence of the protein. The amino acid sequence of a protein is specified by the nucleotide
sequence of its gene, so the domains present in a protein can be determined
from the nucleotide sequence of the gene that codes for that protein. The
genes in a genome can therefore be categorized according to the protein
domains that they specify. This method has the advantage that it can be
applied to genes whose functions are not known and hence can encompass a
larger proportion of the set of genes in a genome.
Classification schemes that use domains to infer gene function suggest that
all eukaryotes possess the same basic set of genes, but that more complex
species have a greater number of genes in each category. For example,
humans have the greatest number of genes in all but one of the categories
used in Figure 7.17, the exception being “metabolism” where Arabidopsis
comes out on top as a result of its photosynthetic capability, which requires a
large set of genes not present in the other four genomes included in this comparison. This functional classification reveals other interesting features,
notably that C. elegans has a relatively high number of genes involved in
cell–cell signaling, which is surprising given that this organism has just
959 cells. Humans, who have 1013 cells, have only 250 more genes for cell–cell

signaling. In general, this type of analysis emphasizes the similarities
between genomes, but does not reveal the genetic basis of the vastly different
types of biological information contained in the genomes of, for example,
fruit flies and humans. The domain approach is, however, promising in this
respect because it shows that the human genome specifies a number of protein domains that are absent from the genomes of the other organisms, these
domains including several involved in activities such as cell adhesion, electrical coupling between cells, and growth of nerve cells (Table 7.5). These functions are interesting because they are ones that we look on as conferring the
distinctive features of vertebrates compared with other types of eukaryote.
Is it possible to identify a set of genes that are present in vertebrates but not
in other eukaryotes? This analysis can only be done in an approximate way at
present because only a few genome sequences are available. It currently
appears that approximately one-fifth to one-quarter of the genes in the
human genome are unique to vertebrates, and a further one-quarter are
found only in vertebrates and other animals (Figure 7.18).

Families of genes
Since the earliest days of DNA sequencing it has been known that multigene
families—groups of genes of identical or similar sequence—are common features of many genomes. For example, every eukaryote that has been studied
(as well as all but the simplest bacteria) has multiple copies of the genes for
the ribosomal RNAs. This is illustrated by the human genome, which contains
approximately 2000 genes for the 5S rRNA (so-called because it has a sedimentation coefficient of 5S; see Technical Note 7.1), all located in a single
cluster on chromosome 1. There are also about 280 copies of a repeat unit
containing the 28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNA genes, grouped into five clusters of
50–70 repeats, one on each of chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, and 22 (see Figure
7.5). Ribosomal RNAs are components of the protein-synthesizing particles
called ribosomes, and it is presumed that their genes are present in multiple
copies because there is a heavy demand for rRNA synthesis during cell division, when several tens of thousands of new ribosomes must be assembled.
The rRNA genes are examples of “simple” or “classical” multigene families, in
which all the members have identical or nearly identical sequences. These
families are believed to have arisen by gene duplication, with the sequences of
the individual members kept identical by an evolutionary process that, as yet,
has not been fully described (Section 18.2.1). Other multigene families, more
common in higher eukaryotes than in lower eukaryotes, are called “complex”
because the individual members, although similar in sequence, are sufficiently
different for the gene products to have distinctive properties. One of the best
examples of this type of multigene family are the mammalian globin genes.
The globins are the blood proteins that combine to make hemoglobin, each
molecule of hemoglobin being made up of two a-type and two b-type globins.
In humans the a-type globins are coded by a small multigene family on chromosome 16, and the b-type globins by a second family on chromosome 11
(Figure 7.19). These genes were among the first to be sequenced, back in the
late 1970s. The sequence data showed that the genes in each family are similar
to one another, but by no means identical. In fact the nucleotide sequences of
the two most different genes in the b-type cluster, coding for the b- and e-globins, display only 79.1% identity. Although this is similar enough for both proteins to be b-type globins, it is sufficiently different for them to have distinctive
biochemical properties. Similar variations are seen in the a-cluster.
Why are the members of the globin gene families so different from one
another? The answer was revealed when the expression patterns of the individual genes were studied. It was discovered that the genes are expressed at
different stages in human development: for example, in the b-type cluster, e
is expressed in the early embryo, Gg and Ag (whose protein products differ by
just one amino acid) in the fetus, and d and b in the adult (Figure 7.19). The
different biochemical properties of the resulting globin proteins are thought

contain genes that are expressed at
different developmental stages and each
includes at least one pseudogene. Note that
expression of the a-type gene x2 begins in
the embryo and continues during the fetal
stage; there is no fetal-specific a-type
globin. The q pseudogene is expressed but
its protein product is inactive. None of the
other pseudogenes is expressed. For more

to reflect slight changes in the physiological role that hemoglobin plays during the course of human development.

Functional gene

In some multigene families, the individual members are clustered, as with the
globin genes, but in others the genes are dispersed around the genome. An
example of a dispersed family is the five human genes for aldolase, an enzyme
involved in energy generation, which are located on chromosomes 3, 9, 10, 16,
and 17. The important point is that, even though dispersed, the members of
the multigene family have sequence similarities that point to a common evolutionary origin. When these sequence comparisons are made it is sometimes
possible to see relationships not only within a single gene family but also
between different families. All of the genes in the a- and b-globin families, for
example, have some sequence similarity and are thought to have evolved from
a single ancestral globin gene. We therefore refer to these two multigene families as comprising a single globin gene superfamily, and from the similarities
between the individual genes we can chart the duplication events that have
given rise to the series of genes that we see today (Section 18.2.1).

Transcription

Pseudogenes and other evolutionary relics
RNA
Reverse transcription

DNA

The human globin gene clusters contain five genes that are no longer active.
These are pseudogenes, nonfunctional gene copies. Pseudogenes are a type
of evolutionary relic, an indication that genomes are continually undergoing
change. There are two main types of pseudogene:
G

A conventional pseudogene is a gene that has been inactivated because
its nucleotide sequence has changed by mutation (Chapter 16). Many
mutations have only minor effects on the activity of a gene but some are
more important, and it is quite possible for a single nucleotide change to
result in a gene becoming completely nonfunctional. Once a pseudogene
has become nonfunctional it will degrade through accumulation of more
mutations, and eventually will no longer be recognizable as a gene relic.
The globin pseudogenes are examples of conventional pseudogenes.

G

A processed pseudogene arises not by evolutionary decay but by an abnormal adjunct to gene expression. A processed pseudogene is derived from
the mRNA copy of a gene by synthesis of a cDNA copy which subsequently
reinserts into the genome (Figure 7.20). Because a processed pseudogene is
a copy of an mRNA molecule, it does not contain any introns that were present in its parent gene. It also lacks the nucleotide sequences immediately
upstream of the parent gene, which is the region in which the signals used
to switch on expression of the parent gene are located. The absence of these
signals means that a processed pseudogene is inactive.

pseudogene. A processed pseudogene is
thought to arise by integration into the
genome of a copy of the mRNA transcribed
from a functional gene. The mRNA is
reverse transcribed into a cDNA copy, which
might integrate into the same chromosome
as its functional parent, or possibly into a
different chromosome.

As well as pseudogenes, genomes also contain other evolutionary relics in the
form of truncated genes, which lack a greater or lesser stretch from one end
of the complete gene, and gene fragments, which are short, isolated regions
from within a gene (Figure 7.21).

The human genome sequence revealed that approximately 62% of the human
genome comprises intergenic regions, the parts of the genome that lie
between genes and which have no known function. These sequences used to
be called junk DNA but the term is falling out of favor, partly because the

has meant that molecular biologists have become less confident in asserting
that any part of the genome is unimportant simply because we do not currently know what its function might be. As we have seen, in most organisms
the bulk of the intergenic DNA is made up of repeated sequences of one type
or another. Repetitive DNA can be divided into two categories (Figure 7.22):
genome-wide or interspersed repeats, whose individual repeat units are distributed around the genome in an apparently random fashion, and tandemly
repeated DNA, whose repeat units are placed next to each other in an array.

Tandemly repeated DNA is found at centromeres and elsewhere in
eukaryotic chromosomes
Tandemly repeated DNA is also called satellite DNA because DNA fragments
containing tandemly repeated sequences form “satellite” bands when
genomic DNA is fractionated by density gradient centrifugation (see
Technical Note 7.1). For example, when broken into fragments 50–100 kb in
length, human DNA forms a main band (buoyant density 1.701 g cm–3) and
three satellite bands (1.687, 1.693, and 1.697 g cm–3). The main band contains
DNA fragments made up mostly of single-copy sequences with GC compositions close to 40.3%, the average value for the human genome. The satellite
bands contain fragments of repetitive DNA, and hence have GC contents and
buoyant densities that are atypical of the genome as a whole (Figure 7.23).
This repetitive DNA is made up of long series of tandem repeats, possibly
hundreds of kilobases in length. A single genome can contain several different types of satellite DNA, each with a different repeat unit, these units being
anything from less than 5 to more than 200 bp in length. The three satellite
bands in human DNA include at least four different repeat types.
We have already encountered one type of human satellite DNA, the alphoid
DNA repeats found in the centromere regions of chromosomes (Section
7.1.2). Although some satellite DNA is scattered around the genome, most is
located in the centromeres, where it may play a structural role, possibly as
binding sites for one or more of the special centromeric proteins.

Minisatellites and microsatellites
Although not appearing in satellite bands on density gradients, two other
types of tandemly repeated DNA are also classed as “satellite” DNA. These are
minisatellites and microsatellites. Minisatellites form clusters up to 20 kb in
length, with repeat units up to 25 bp in length; microsatellite clusters are
shorter, usually less than 150 bp, and the repeat unit is usually 13 bp or less.
Minisatellite DNA is a second type of repetitive DNA that we are already
familiar with because of its association with structural features of chromosomes. Telomeric DNA, which in humans comprises hundreds of copies of
the motif 5¢–TTAGGG–3¢ (see Figure 7.10), is an example of a minisatellite. We

Fragments made up mainly of single-copy
DNA have a GC content close to this

consist of fragments containing repetitive
DNA. The GC contents of these fragments
depend on their repeat motif sequences
and are different from the genome average,
meaning that these fragments have
different buoyant densities to single-copy
DNA and migrate to different positions in
the density gradient.

know a certain amount about how telomeric DNA is formed, and we know
that it has an important function in DNA replication (Section 15.2.4). In addition to telomeric minisatellites, some eukaryotic genomes contain various
other clusters of minisatellite DNA, many, although not all, near the ends of
chromosomes. The functions of these other minisatellite sequences have not
been identified.
Microsatellites are also examples of tandemly repeated DNA. In a microsatellite the repeat unit is short—up to 13 bp in length. The commonest type of
human microsatellite are dinucleotide repeats, with approximately 140,000
copies in the genome as a whole, about half of these being repeats of the
motif “CA.” Single-nucleotide repeats (e.g., AAAAA) are the next most common (about 120,000 copies in total). As with genome-wide repeats, it is not
clear if microsatellites have a function. It is known that they arise through an
error in the process responsible for copying of the genome during cell division (Section 16.1.1), and they might simply be unavoidable products of
genome replication.
Although their function, if any, is unknown, microsatellites have proved very
useful to geneticists. Many microsatellites are variable, meaning that the
number of repeat units in the array is different in different members of a
species. This is because “slippage” sometimes occurs when a microsatellite is
copied during DNA replication, leading to insertion or, less frequently, deletion of one or more of the repeat units (see Figure 16.5). No two humans alive
today have exactly the same combination of microsatellite length variants: if
enough microsatellites are examined then a unique genetic profile can be
established for every person. The only exceptions are genetically identical
twins. Genetic profiling is well known as a tool in forensic science (Figure
7.24), but identification of criminals is a fairly trivial application of
microsatellite variability. More sophisticated methodology makes use of the
fact that a person’s genetic profile is inherited partly from the mother and
partly from the father. This means that microsatellites can be used to establish kinship relationships and population affinities, not only for humans but
also for other animals, and for plants.

Interspersed repeats

Figure 7.24 The use of microsatellite
analysis in genetic profiling. In this
example, microsatellites located on the short
arm of chromosome 6 have been amplified
by PCR. The PCR products are labeled with
a blue or green fluorescent marker and run
in a polyacrylamide gel, each lane showing
the genetic profile of a different individual.
No two individuals have the same genetic
profile because each person has a different
set of microsatellite length variants, the
variants giving rise to bands of different
sizes after PCR. The red bands are DNA size
markers. Image courtesy of Applied
Biosystems, Warrington, UK.

Tandemly repeated DNA sequences are thought to have arisen by expansion
of a progenitor sequence, either by replication slippage, as described for
microsatellites, or by DNA recombination processes (Chapter 17). Both of
these events are likely to result in a series of linked repeats, rather than individual repeat units scattered around the genome. Interspersed repeats must
therefore have arisen by a different mechanism, one that can result in a copy
of a repeat unit appearing in the genome at a position distant from the location of the original sequence. The most frequent way in which this occurs is by
transposition, and most interspersed repeats have inherent transpositional
activity. Transposition is also a feature of some viral genomes, which are able
to insert into the genome of the infected cell and then move from place to
place within that genome. Some interspersed repeats are clearly descended
from transposable viruses, and because of this relationship we will postpone
discussion of these and the other types of genome-wide repeat until Chapter
9, after we have looked in detail at the features of virus genomes.

Summary

Summary
The eukaryotic nuclear genome is split into a set of linear DNA molecules,
each of which is contained in a chromosome. Within a chromosome, the DNA
is packaged by association with histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which
interact with one another to give the 30 nm fiber and higher orders of chromatin structure. The most compact organization results in the metaphase
chromosomes that can be observed by light microscopy of dividing cells and
which take up characteristic banding patterns after staining. The centromeres, which are visible in metaphase chromosomes, contain special proteins that make up the kinetochore, the attachment point for the microtubules which draw the divided chromosomes into the daughter nuclei. In S.
cerevisiae, the centromeric DNA which acts as the binding site for these proteins is approximately 125 bp in length, but in most other eukaryotes this
DNA region is much longer and is made up of repetitive DNA. Telomeres, the
structures which maintain the chromosome ends, also contain repetitive
DNA and special binding proteins. Genes are not evenly spread along chromosomes, the density in human chromosomes ranging from 0 to 64 genes
per 100 kb. The coding parts of genes comprise only a small part of the
human genome, less than 1.5%, with 44% of the genome made up of various
types of repetitive DNA sequence. In contrast, the S. cerevisiae genome is
much more compact, with only 3.4% taken up by repeat sequences. In general, larger genomes are less compact, explaining why organisms with similar
numbers of genes can have genomes of very different sizes. Humans have
30,000–40,000 genes, about twice as many as the nematode worm
Caenorhabditis elegans and about the same number as rice. Comparisons of
gene catalogs listing the functions of the genes in a genome suggest that all
eukaryotes possess the same basic set of genes, but that more complex
species have a greater number of genes in each functional category. Many
genes are organized into multigene families whose members have similar or
identical sequences, and in some families, such as the vertebrate globin
genes, the members are expressed at different developmental stages.
Eukaryotic nuclear genomes also contain evolutionary relics, such as nonfunctional pseudogenes and gene fragments. The repetitive DNA content can
be divided into interspersed DNA, much of which has transpositional activity, and tandemly repeated DNA, which includes the satellite DNA found at
centromeres, minisatellites such as telomeric DNA, and microsatellites which
are used by forensic scientists in genetic profiling.

8.1 The Physical Features of Prokaryotic

8.3 Eukaryotic Organelle Genomes

When you have read Chapter 8, you should be able to:
Describe how bacterial DNA is packaged into a nucleoid, and give the experimental evidence for
the domain model of the Escherichia coli nucleoid.
Give examples of prokaryotic genomes that are linear and/or multipartite, and explain why the
presence of plasmids in some prokaryotic cells complicates definition of what constitutes the
“genome.”
Outline the important features of gene organization in prokaryotic genomes.
Define, with examples, the term “operon.”
Discuss the relationship between gene number and genome size in prokaryotes, and speculate on
the content of the minimal prokaryotic genome and on the identity of distinctiveness genes.
Discuss the endosymbiont hypothesis for the origins of organelle genomes.
Describe the physical features and gene contents of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes.

Prokaryotes are organisms whose cells lack extensive internal compartments.
There are two very different groups of prokaryotes, distinguished from one
another by characteristic genetic and biochemical features:
G

The bacteria, which include most of the commonly encountered prokaryotes such as the gram-negatives (e.g., Escherichia coli), the gram-positives
(e.g., Bacillus subtilis), the cyanobacteria (e.g., Anabaena), and many more.

G

The archaea, which are less-well studied, and have mostly been found in
extreme environments such as hot springs, brine pools, and anaerobic
lake bottoms.

In this chapter we will examine the genomes of prokaryotes, and also of
eukaryotic mitochondria and chloroplasts which, as they are descended from
bacteria, have genomes that display many prokaryotic features. Because of
the relatively small sizes of prokaryotic genomes, several hundred complete
genome sequences for various bacteria and archaea have been published

over the last few years. As a result, we are beginning to understand a great
deal about the anatomies of prokaryotic genomes, and in some respects we
know more about these organisms than we do about eukaryotes. The picture
that is emerging is one of immense variability among the prokaryotes as a
whole and in some cases even between closely related species.

8.1 The Physical Features of Prokaryotic Genomes
Prokaryotic genomes are very different from eukaryotic ones, in particular
with regard to the physical organization of the genome within the cell.
Although the word “chromosome” is used to describe the DNA–protein structures present in prokaryotic cells, this is a misnomer as this structure has few
similarities with a eukaryotic chromosome.

8.1.1 The chromosomes of prokaryotes
The traditional view has been that in a typical prokaryote the genome is contained in a single, circular DNA molecule, localized within the nucleoid—the
lightly staining region of the otherwise featureless prokaryotic cell (Figure 8.1).
This is certainly true for E. coli and many of the other commonly studied bacteria. However, as we will see, our growing knowledge of prokaryotic genomes
is leading us to question several of the preconceptions that became established
during the pregenome era of microbiology. These preconceptions relate both to
the physical structure of the prokaryotic genome and its genetic organization.

The traditional view of the prokaryotic chromosome
As with eukaryotic chromosomes, a prokaryotic genome has to squeeze into
a relatively tiny space (the circular E. coli chromosome has a circumference of
1.6 mm whereas an E. coli cell is just 1.0 ¥ 2.0 mm) and, as with eukaryotes,
this is achieved with the help of DNA-binding proteins that package the
genome in an organized fashion.

Figure 8.2 Supercoiling. The diagram
shows how underwinding a circular, doublestranded DNA molecule results in negative
supercoiling.

Circular, double-stranded DNA

Most of what we know about the organization of DNA in the nucleoid comes
from studies of E. coli. The first feature to be recognized was that the circular
E. coli genome is supercoiled. Supercoiling occurs when additional turns are
introduced into the DNA double helix (positive supercoiling) or if turns are
removed (negative supercoiling). With a linear molecule, the torsional stress
introduced by over- or underwinding is immediately released by rotation of
the ends of the DNA molecule, but a circular molecule, having no ends, cannot reduce the strain in this way. Instead the circular molecule responds by

winding around itself to form a more compact structure (Figure 8.2).
Supercoiling is therefore an ideal way to package a circular molecule into a
small space. Evidence that supercoiling is involved in packaging the circular E.
coli genome was first obtained in the 1970s from examination of isolated
nucleoids, and subsequently confirmed as a feature of DNA in living cells in
1981. In E. coli, the supercoiling is thought to be generated and controlled by
two enzymes, DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase I, which we will look at in
more detail in Section 15.1.2 when we examine the roles of these enzymes in
DNA replication.

The current model has the E. coli DNA attached to a protein core from which
40–50 supercoiled loops radiate out into the cell. Each loop contains approximately 100 kb of supercoiled DNA, the amount of DNA that becomes
unwound after a single break. The protein component of the nucleoid
includes DNA gyrase and DNA topoisomerase I, the two enzymes that are
primarily responsible for maintaining the supercoiled state, as well as a set of
at least four proteins believed to have a more specific role in packaging the
bacterial DNA. The most abundant of these packaging proteins is HU, which

Trimethylpsoralen binding (%)

Studies of isolated nucleoids suggest that the E. coli DNA molecule does not
have unlimited freedom to rotate once a break is introduced. The most likely
explanation is that the bacterial DNA is attached to proteins that restrict its
ability to relax, so that rotation at a break site results in loss of supercoiling
from only a small segment of the molecule (Figure 8.3). The strongest evidence for this domain model has come from experiments that exploit the ability of trimethylpsoralen to distinguish between supercoiled and relaxed DNA.
When photoactivated by a pulse of light of wavelength 360 nm, trimethylpsoralen binds to double-stranded DNA at a rate that is directly proportional to
the degree of torsional stress possessed by the molecule. The degree of supercoiling can therefore be assayed by measuring the amount of trimethylpsoralen that binds to a molecule in unit time. After E. coli cells have been irradiated to introduce single-strand breaks into their DNA molecules, the amount
of trimethylpsoralen binding is proportional to the radiation dose (Figure 8.4).
This is the response predicted by the domain model, in which the overall
supercoiling of the molecule is gradually relaxed as greater doses of radiation
cause breaks within an increasing number of domains. In contrast, if the E.
coli nucleoid was not organized into domains then a single break in the DNA
molecule would lead to complete loss of supercoiling: irradiation would
therefore have an all-or-nothing effect on trimethylpsoralen binding.

is structurally very different to eukaryotic histones but acts in a similar way,
forming a tetramer around which approximately 60 bp of DNA becomes
wound. There are some 60,000 HU proteins per E. coli cell, enough to cover
about one-fifth of the DNA molecule, but it is not known if the tetramers are
evenly spaced along the DNA or restricted to the core region of the nucleoid.
The above discussion refers specifically to the E. coli chromosome, which we
look on as typical of bacterial chromosomes in general. But we must be careful to make a distinction between the bacterial chromosome and that of the
second group of prokaryotes, the archaea. One reason why the archaea are
looked upon as a distinct group of organisms, different from the bacteria, is
that archaea do not possess packaging proteins such as HU but instead have
proteins that are much more similar to histones. These form a tetramer that
associates with approximately 80 bp of DNA to form a structure similar to a
eukaryotic nucleosome (see Figure 7.2). Currently we have very little information on the archaeal nucleoid, but the assumption is that these histone-like
proteins play a central role in DNA packaging.

Some bacteria have linear or multipartite genomes
The E. coli genome, as described above, is a single, circular DNA molecule.
This is also the case with the vast majority of bacterial and archaeal chromosomes that have been studied, but an increasing number of linear versions
are being found. The first of these, for Borrelia burgdorferi, the organism that
causes Lyme disease, was described in 1989, and during the following years
similar discoveries were made for Streptomyces coelicolor and Agrobacterium
tumefaciens. Linear molecules have free ends, which must be distinguishable
from DNA breaks, so these chromosomes require terminal structures equivalent to the telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes (Section 7.1.2). In Borrelia
and Agrobacterium, the real chromosome ends are distinguishable because a
covalent linkage is formed between the 5¢ and 3¢ ends of the polynucleotides
in the DNA double helix, and in Streptomyces the ends appear to be marked
by special binding proteins.

Nucleoid

A second and more widespread variation on the E. coli theme is the presence
in some prokaryotes of multipartite genomes—genomes that are divided into
two or more DNA molecules. With these multipartite genomes a problem often
arises in distinguishing a genuine part of the genome from a plasmid. A plasmid is a small piece of DNA, often but not always circular, that coexists with the
main chromosome in a bacterial cell (Figure 8.5). Some types of plasmid are
able to integrate into the main genome, but others are thought to be permanently independent. Plasmids carry genes that are not usually present in the
main chromosome, but in many cases these genes are nonessential to the bacterium, coding for characteristics such as antibiotic resistance, which the bacterium does not need if the environmental conditions are amenable (Table
8.1). As well as this apparent dispensability, many plasmids are able to transfer
from one cell to another, and the same plasmids are sometimes found in bacteria that belong to different species. These various features of plasmids suggest that they are independent entities and that in most cases the plasmid content of a prokaryotic cell should not be included in the definition of its genome.

Plasmids

Figure 8.5 Plasmids are small, circular
DNA molecules that are found inside
some prokaryotic cells.

With a bacterium such as E. coli K12, which has a 4.6 Mb chromosome and
can harbor various combinations of plasmids, none of which is more than a
few kilobases in size and all of which are dispensable, it is acceptable to
define the main chromosome as the “genome.” With other prokaryotes it is

not so easy (Table 8.2). Vibrio cholerae, the pathogenic bacterium that causes
cholera, has two circular DNA molecules, one of 2.96 Mb and the other of 1.07
Mb, with 71% of the organism’s 3885 genes on the larger of these. It would
appear obvious that these two DNA molecules together constitute the Vibrio
genome, but closer examination reveals that most of the genes for the central
cellular activities such as genome expression and energy generation, as well
as the genes that confer pathogenicity, are located on the larger molecule. The
smaller molecule contains many essential genes but also has certain features
that are considered characteristic of plasmids, notably the presence of an
integron—a set of genes and other DNA sequences that enable plasmids to
capture genes from bacteriophages and other plasmids. It therefore appears
possible that the smaller genome is a “megaplasmid” that was acquired by the
ancestor to Vibrio at some period in the bacterium’s evolutionary past.
Deinococcus radiodurans R1, whose genome is of particular interest because
it contains many genes that help this bacterium resist the harmful effects of
radiation, is constructed on similar lines, with essential genes distributed
among two circular chromosomes and two plasmids. However, the Vibrio and
Deinococcus genomes are relatively noncomplex compared with Borrelia
burgdorferi B31, whose linear chromosome of 911 kb, carrying 853 genes, is
accompanied by 17 or 18 linear and circular plasmids, which together contribute another 533 kb and at least 430 genes. Although the functions of most
of these genes are unknown, those that have been identified include several
that would not normally be considered dispensable, such as genes for membrane proteins and purine biosynthesis. The implication is that at least some
of the Borrelia plasmids are essential components of the genome, leading to
the possibility that some prokaryotes have highly multipartite genomes,
comprising a number of separate DNA molecules, more akin to what we see
in the eukaryotic nucleus rather than the “typical” prokaryotic arrangement.
This interpretation of the Borrelia genome is still controversial, and is complicated by the fact that the related bacterium Treponema pallidum, whose
genome is a single, circular DNA molecule of 1138 kb containing 1041 genes,
does not contain any of the genes present on the Borrelia plasmids.

8.2 The Genetic Features of Prokaryotic Genomes
Gene location by sequence inspection is much easier for prokaryotes compared with eukaryotes (Section 5.1.1), and for most of the prokaryotic
genomes that have been sequenced we have reasonably accurate estimates of
gene number and fairly comprehensive lists of gene functions. The results of
these studies have been surprising, and have forced microbiologists to reconsider the meaning of “species” when applied to prokaryotes. We will examine
these evolutionary issues in Section 8.2.3. First, we must look at the way in
which the genes are organized in a prokaryotic genome.

8.2.1 How are the genes organized in a prokaryotic genome?
We are already familiar with the notion that bacterial genomes have compact genetic organizations with very little space between genes, as this was
an important part of our discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of ORF
scanning as a means of identifying the genes in a genome sequence (see
Figure 5.3). To reemphasize this point, the complete circular gene map of the
E. coli K12 genome is shown in Figure 8.6. There is noncoding DNA in the
E. coli genome, but it accounts for only 11% of the total and it is distributed

around the genome in small segments that do not show up when the map is
drawn at this scale. In this regard, E. coli is typical of all prokaryotes whose
genomes have so far been sequenced—prokaryotic genomes have very little
wasted space. There are theories that this compact organization is beneficial
to prokaryotes, for example by enabling the genome to be replicated relatively quickly, but these ideas have never been supported by hard experimental evidence.

Gene organization in the E. coli genome
Let us look more closely at the E. coli genome. A typical 50 kb segment is
shown in Figure 8.7. When we compare this segment with a typical part of the
human genome (see Figure 7.12), it is immediately obvious that in the E. coli
segment there are more genes and much less space between them, with 43
genes taking up 85.9% of the segment. Some genes have virtually no space
between them: thrA and thrB, for example, are separated by a single
nucleotide, and thrC begins at the nucleotide immediately following the last
nucleotide of thrB. These three genes are an example of an operon, a group
of genes involved in a single biochemical pathway (in this case, synthesis of
the amino acid threonine) and expressed in conjunction with one another. In
general, prokaryotic genes are shorter than their eukaryotic counterparts, the
average length of a bacterial gene being about two-thirds that of a eukaryotic
gene, even after the introns have been removed from the latter. Bacterial
genes appear to be slightly longer than archaeal ones.

Escherichia coli genome.

Two other features of prokaryotic genomes can be deduced from Figure 8.7.
First, there are no introns in the genes present in this segment of the E. coli
genome. In fact E. coli has no discontinuous genes at all, and it is generally
believed that discontinuous genes are virtually absent in prokaryotes, the
few exceptions occurring mainly among the archaea. The second feature is
the infrequency of repetitive sequences. Most prokaryotic genomes do not
have anything equivalent to the high-copy-number genome-wide repeat
families found in eukaryotic genomes. They do, however, possess certain
sequences that might be repeated elsewhere in the genome, examples being
the insertion sequences IS1 and IS186 that can be seen in the 50 kb segment
shown in Figure 8.7. These are examples of transposable elements,
sequences that have the ability to move around the genome and, in the case
of insertion elements, to transfer from one organism to another, even sometimes between two different species (Section 9.2.2). The positions of the IS1
and IS186 elements shown in Figure 8.7 refer only to the particular E. coli isolate from which this sequence was obtained: if a different isolate is examined
then the IS sequences could well be in different positions or might be entirely
absent from the genome. Most other prokaryotic genomes have very few
repeat sequences—there are virtually none in the 1.64 Mb genome of
Campylobacter jejuni NCTC11168—but there are exceptions, notably the
meningitis bacterium Neisseria meningitidis Z2491, which has over 3700
copies of 15 different types of repeat sequence, collectively making up almost
11% of the 2.18 Mb genome.

Operons are characteristic features of prokaryotic genomes
One characteristic feature of prokaryotic genomes illustrated by E. coli is the
presence of operons. In the years before genome sequences were known, it
was thought that we understood operons very well; now we are not so sure.
An operon is a group of genes that are located adjacent to one another in the
genome, with perhaps just one or two nucleotides between the end of one
gene and the start of the next. All the genes in an operon are expressed as a
single unit. This type of arrangement is common in prokaryotic genomes. A
typical E. coli example is the lactose operon, the first operon to be discovered,
which contains three genes involved in conversion of the disaccharide sugar
lactose into its monosaccharide units—glucose and galactose (Figure 8.8A).
The monosaccharides are substrates for the energy-generating glycolytic
pathway, so the function of the genes in the lactose operon is to convert lactose into a form that can be utilized by E. coli as an energy source. Lactose is
not a common component of E. coli’s natural environment, so most of the
time the operon is not expressed and the enzymes for lactose utilization are
not made by the bacterium. When lactose becomes available, it switches on
the operon; all three genes are expressed together, resulting in coordinated
synthesis of the lactose-utilizing enzymes. This is the classic example of gene
regulation in bacteria, and is examined in detail in Section 11.3.1.

galactose and glucose. (B) The tryptophan

4 bp, and trpC and trpB by 12 bp. For more

Altogether there are almost 600 operons in the E. coli K12 genome, each containing two or more genes, and a similar number are present in Bacillus subtilis. In most cases the genes in an operon are functionally related, coding for
a set of proteins that are involved in a single biochemical activity such as utilization of a sugar as an energy source or synthesis of an amino acid. An example of the latter is the tryptophan operon of E. coli (Figure 8.8B). Microbial
geneticists are attracted to the simplicity of this system whereby a bacterium
is able to control its various biochemical activities by regulating the expression
of groups of related genes linked together in operons. This may be a correct
interpretation of the function of operons in E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and many
other prokaryotes, but in at least some species the picture is less straightforward. Both the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii and the bacterium
Aquifex aeolicus have operons, but the genes in an individual operon rarely
have any biochemical relationship. For example, one of the operons in the
A. aeolicus genome contains six linked genes, these genes coding for two proteins involved in DNA recombination, an enzyme used in protein synthesis, a
protein required for motility, an enzyme involved in nucleotide synthesis, and
an enzyme for lipid synthesis (Figure 8.9). This is typical of the operon structure in the A. aeolicus and M. jannaschii genomes. In other words, the notion

that expression of an operon leads to the coordinated synthesis of enzymes
required for a single biochemical pathway does not hold for these species.
Genome projects have therefore confused our understanding of operons. It is
certainly too early to abandon the belief that operons play a central role in
biochemical regulation in many bacteria, but we need to explain the unexpected features of the operons in A. aeolicus and M. jannaschii. It has been
pointed out that both A. aeolicus and M. jannaschii are autotrophs, which
means that, unlike many prokaryotes, they are able to synthesize organic
compounds from carbon dioxide, but how this similarity between the species
might be used to explain their operon structures is not clear.

8.2.2 How many genes are there and what are their
functions?
There is some overlap in size between the largest prokaryotic and smallest
eukaryotic genomes, but on the whole prokaryotic genomes are much
smaller (Table 8.3). For example, the E. coli K12 genome is just 4639 kb, twofifths the size of the yeast genome, and has only 4405 genes. Most prokaryotic genomes are less than 5 Mb in size, but the overall range among
sequenced genomes is from 491 kb for Nanoarchaeum equitans to 9.1 Mb for
Bradyrhizobium japonicum, and a few unsequenced genomes are substantially larger than this: Bacillus megaterium, for example, has a huge genome
of 30 Mb.
Most of these genomes are organized along similar lines to E. coli, which
means that genome size is proportional to gene number, with an average of
approximately 950 genes per 1 Mb of DNA. Gene numbers therefore vary over
an extensive range, with these numbers reflecting the nature of the ecological

niches within which different species of prokaryote live. The largest genomes
tend to belong to free-living species that are found in the soil, the environment which is generally looked on as providing the broadest range of physical and biological conditions, to which the genomes of these species must be
able to respond. At the other end of the scale, many of the smallest genomes
belong to species that are obligate parasites, such as Mycoplasma genitalium,
which has just 470 genes in a 0.58 Mb genome. The limited coding capacity of
these small genomes means that these species are unable to synthesize many
nutrients and hence must obtain these from their hosts. This is illustrated by
Table 8.4, which compares the gene catalog of M. genitalium with that of
E. coli. We see that, for instance, E. coli has 131 genes for biosynthesis of
amino acids whereas M. genitalium has just one, that E. coli has 103 genes for
cofactor synthesis compared with five in M. genitalium, and so on.
These comparisons have led to speculation about the smallest number of
genes needed to specify a free-living cell. Theoretical considerations initially
led to the suggestion that 256 genes are the minimum required, but experiments in which increasing numbers of Mycoplasma genes have been
mutated suggest that 265–350 are needed. There has been similar interest in
searching for “distinctiveness” genes—ones that distinguish one species
from another. Of the 470 genes in the M. genitalium genome, 350 are also
present in the distantly related bacterium Bacillus subtilis, which suggests
that the biochemical and structural features that distinguish a Mycoplasma
from a Bacillus are encoded in the 120 or so genes that are unique to the former. Unfortunately, the identities of these supposed distinctiveness genes do

not provide any obvious clues about what makes a bacterium a Mycoplasma
rather than anything else.

8.2.3 Prokaryotic genomes and the species concept
Genome projects have confused our understanding of what constitutes a
“species” in the prokaryotic world. This has always been a problem in microbiology because the standard biological definitions of species have been difficult to apply to microorganisms. The early taxonomists such as Linneaus
described species in morphological terms, all members of one species having
the same or very similar structural features. This form of classification was in
vogue until the early twentieth century and was first applied to microorganisms in the 1880s by Robert Koch and others, who used staining and biochemical tests to distinguish between bacterial species. However, it was recognized that this type of classification was imprecise because many of the
resulting species were made up of a variety of types with quite different properties. An example is provided by E. coli which, like many bacterial species,
includes strains with distinctive pathogenic characteristics, ranging from
harmless through to lethal. During the twentieth century, biologists redefined
the species concept in evolutionary terms, and we now look on a species as a
group of organisms that can interbreed with one another. If anything, this is
more problematic with microorganisms because there are a variety of methods by which genes can be exchanged between prokaryotes that, according to
their biochemical and physiological properties, are different species (see
Figure 3.23). The barrier to gene flow that is central to the species concept
therefore does not hold with prokaryotes.
Genome sequencing has emphasized the difficulties in applying the species
concept to prokaryotes. It has become clear that different strains of a single
species can have very different genome sequences, and may even have individual sets of strain-specific genes. This was first shown by a comparison
between two strains of Helicobacter pylori, which causes gastric ulcers and
other diseases of the human digestive tract. The two strains were isolated in
the United Kingdom and the United States and have genomes of 1.67 Mb and
1.64 Mb, respectively. The larger genome contains 1552 genes and the smaller
one 1495 genes, 1406 of these genes being present in both strains. In other
words, some 6%–9% of the gene content of each genome is unique to that
strain. A much more extreme distinction between strains was revealed when
the genome sequence of the common laboratory strain of E. coli, K12, was
compared with that of one of the most pathogenic strains, O157:H7. The
lengths of the two genomes are significantly different—4.64 Mb for K12 and
5.53 Mb for O157:H7—with the extra DNA in the pathogenic strain scattered
around the genome at almost 200 separate positions. These “O-islands” contain 1387 genes not present in E. coli K12, many of these genes coding for toxins and other proteins that are clearly involved in the pathogenic properties
of O157:H7. But it is not simply a case of O157:H7 containing extra genes that
make it pathogenic. K12 also has 234 segments of its own unique DNA, and
although these “K-islands” are, on average, smaller than the O-islands, they
still contain 528 genes that are absent from O157:H7. The situation, therefore,
is that E. coli O157:H7 and E. coli K12 each has a set of strain-specific genes,
which make up 26% and 12% of the gene catalogs, respectively. This is substantially more variation than can be tolerated by the species concept as

applied to higher organisms, and is difficult to reconcile with any definition
of species yet devised for microorganisms.
The difficulties become even more acute when other bacterial and archaeal
genomes are examined. Because of the ease with which genes can flow
between different prokaryotic species, it was anticipated that the same genes
would occasionally be found in different species, but the extent of lateral
gene transfer revealed by sequencing has taken everybody by surprise. Most
genomes contain a few hundred kilobases of DNA acquired directly from a
different species, and in some cases the figure is higher: 12.8% of the E. coli
K12 genome, corresponding to 0.59 Mb, has been obtained in this way (Figure
8.10). A second surprise is that transfer has occurred between very different
species, even between bacteria and archaea. For example, the thermophilic
bacterium Thermotoga maritima has 1877 genes, 451 of which appear to have
been obtained from archaeons. Transfer in the other direction, from bacteria
to archaea, is equally prevalent. The picture that is emerging is one in which
prokaryotes living in similar ecological niches exchange genes with one
another in order to increase their individual fitness for survival in their particular environment. Many of the Thermotoga genes that have been obtained
from archaeons have probably helped this bacterium acquire its ability to tolerate high temperatures.
Genome sequencing has also revealed that many bacterial species remain
unidentified. Microbiologists have suspected this for many years, realizing that
the artificial culture conditions used to isolate bacteria from their natural habitats do not suit all species, and that many will not grow under these conditions
and hence will remain undetected. Practitioners of the new field of metagenomics are addressing this problem by obtaining DNA sequences from all the
genomes in a particular habitat, for example from seawater or from an acidic
soil. In one study, over a megabase of sequence was obtained from bacterial
DNA from 1500 liters of surface water from the Sargasso Sea. The sequence
included segments of the genomes of over 1800 species, of which 148 were
totally new. Metagenomics raises the intriguing possibility that in the future we
may have genome sequences for organisms that nobody has ever seen.

Chapter 8 Genomes of Prokaryotes and Eukaryotic Organelles

8.3 Eukaryotic Organelle Genomes
Now we return to the eukaryotic world to examine the genomes present in
mitochondria and chloroplasts. The possibility that some genes might be
located outside the nucleus—extrachromosomal genes as they were initially
called—was first raised in the 1950s as a means of explaining the unusual
inheritance patterns of certain genes in the fungus Neurospora crassa, the
yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the photosynthetic alga Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii. Electron microscopy and biochemical studies at about the same
time provided hints that DNA molecules might be present in mitochondria
and chloroplasts. Eventually, in the early 1960s, these various lines of evidence were brought together and the existence of mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, independent of and distinct from the eukaryotic nuclear
genome, was accepted.

8.3.1 The origins of organelle genomes
The discovery of organelle genomes led to many speculations about their origins. Today most biologists accept that the endosymbiont theory is correct,
at least in outline, even though it was considered quite unorthodox when
first proposed in the 1960s. The endosymbiont theory is based on the observation that the gene expression processes occurring in organelles are similar
in many respects to equivalent processes in bacteria. In addition, when
nucleotide sequences are compared, organelle genes are found to be more
similar to equivalent genes from bacteria than they are to eukaryotic nuclear
genes. The endosymbiont theory therefore holds that mitochondria and
chloroplasts are the relics of free-living bacteria that formed a symbiotic
association with the precursor of the eukaryotic cell, way back at the very
earliest stages of evolution.
Support for the endosymbiont theory has come from the discovery of organisms which appear to exhibit stages of endosymbiosis that are less advanced
than seen with mitochondria and chloroplasts. For example, an early stage in
endosymbiosis is displayed by the protozoan Cyanophora paradoxa, whose
photosynthetic structures, called cyanelles, are different from chloroplasts
and instead resemble ingested cyanobacteria. Similarly, the Rickettsia, which
live inside eukaryotic cells, might be modern versions of the bacteria that
gave rise to mitochondria. It has also been suggested that the hydrogenosomes of trichomonads (unicellular microbes, many of which are parasites)
represent an advanced type of mitochondrial endosymbiosis, as some hydrogenosomes possess a genome but most do not.
If mitochondria and chloroplasts were once free-living bacteria, then since
the endosymbiosis was set up, there must have been a transfer of genes from
the organelle into the nucleus. We do not understand how this occurred, or
indeed whether there was a mass transfer of many genes at once, or a gradual trickle from one site to the other. But we do know that DNA transfer from
organelle to nucleus, and indeed between organelles, still occurs. This was
discovered in the early 1980s, when the first partial sequences of chloroplast
genomes were obtained. It was found that in some plants the chloroplast
genome contains segments of DNA, often including entire genes, that are
copies of parts of the mitochondrial genome. The implication is that this socalled promiscuous DNA has been transferred from one organelle to the
other. We now know that this is not the only type of transfer that can occur.
The Arabidopsis mitochondrial genome contains various segments of

Genomes Chapter 8

nuclear DNA as well as 16 fragments of the chloroplast genome, including six
tRNA genes that have retained their activity after transfer to the mitochondrion. The nuclear genome of this plant includes several short segments of
the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes as well as a 270 kb piece of
mitochondrial DNA located within the centromeric region of chromosome 2.
The transfer of mitochondrial DNA to vertebrate nuclear genomes has also
been documented.

8.3.2 Physical features of organelle genomes
Almost all eukaryotes have mitochondrial genomes, and all photosynthetic
eukaryotes have chloroplast genomes. Initially, it was thought that virtually all
organelle genomes were circular DNA molecules. Electron microscopy had
revealed both circular and linear DNA in some organelles, but it was assumed
that the linear molecules were simply fragments of circular genomes that had
become broken during preparation for electron microscopy. We still believe
that most mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes are circular, but we now
recognize that there is a great deal of variability in different organisms. In
many eukaryotes, the circular genomes coexist in the organelles with linear
versions and, in the case of chloroplasts, with smaller circles that contain subcomponents of the genome as a whole. The latter pattern reaches its extreme
in the marine algae called dinoflagellates, whose chloroplast genomes are
split into many small circles, each containing just a single gene. We also now
realize that the mitochondrial genomes of some microbial eukaryotes (e.g.,
Paramecium, Chlamydomonas, and several yeasts) are always linear.

Copy numbers for organelle genomes are not particularly well understood.
Each human mitochondrion contains about 10 identical molecules, which
means that there are about 8000 per cell, but in S. cerevisiae the total number
is probably smaller (less than 6500) even though there may be over 100
genomes per mitochondrion. Photosynthetic microorganisms such as
Chlamydomonas have approximately 1000 chloroplast genomes per cell,
about one-fifth the number present in a higher plant cell. One mystery,
which dates back to the 1950s and has never been satisfactorily solved, is that
when organelle genes are studied in genetic crosses the results suggest that
there is just one copy of a mitochondrial or chloroplast genome per cell. This
is clearly not the case but indicates that our understanding of the transmission of organelle genomes from parent to offspring is less than perfect.
Mitochondrial genome sizes are variable (Table 8.5) and are unrelated to the
complexity of the organism. Most multicellular animals have small mitochondrial genomes with a compact genetic organization, the genes being
close together with little space between them. The human mitochondrial
genome (Figure 8.11), at 16,569 bp, is typical of this type. Most lower eukaryotes such as S. cerevisiae (Figure 8.12), as well as flowering plants, have larger
and less compact mitochondrial genomes, with a number of the genes containing introns. Chloroplast genomes have less variable sizes (Table 8.5) and
most have a structure similar to that shown in Figure 8.13 for the rice chloroplast genome.

8.3.3 The genetic content of organelle genomes
Organelle genomes are much smaller than their nuclear counterparts and
we therefore anticipate that their gene contents are much more limited,
which is indeed the case. Again, mitochondrial genomes display the greater

variability, gene contents ranging from five for the malaria parasite P. falciparum to 92 for the protozoan Reclinomonas americana (Table 8.6). All
mitochondrial genomes contain genes for the noncoding rRNAs and at least
some of the protein components of the respiratory chain, the latter being the
main biochemical feature of the mitochondrion. The more gene-rich
genomes also code for tRNAs, ribosomal proteins, and proteins involved in
transcription, translation, and transport of other proteins into the mitochondrion from the surrounding cytoplasm (Table 8.6). Most chloroplast
genomes appear to possess the same set of 200 or so genes, again coding for
rRNAs and tRNAs, as well as ribosomal proteins and proteins involved in
photosynthesis (see Figure 8.13).
A general feature of organelle genomes emerges from Table 8.6. These
genomes specify some of the proteins found in the organelle, but not all of
them. The other proteins are coded by nuclear genes, synthesized in the
cytoplasm, and transported into the organelle. If the cell has mechanisms for
transporting proteins into mitochondria and chloroplasts, then why not
have all the organelle proteins specified by the nuclear genome? We do not
yet have a convincing answer to this question, although it has been suggested that at least some of the proteins coded by organelle genomes are
extremely hydrophobic and cannot be transported through the membranes

Because of their relatively small sizes, many
mitochondrial genomes have been
completely sequenced. In the yeast
mitochondrial genome, the genes are more
widely spaced than in the human
mitochondrial genome and some of the
genes have introns. This type of organization
is typical of many lower eukaryotes and
plants. The yeast mitochondrial genome
contains five additional open reading frames
(not shown on this map) that have not yet
been shown to code for functional gene
products, and there are also several genes
located within the introns of the

can get them into the organelle is to make them there in the first place.

Summary
Prokaryotes comprise two distinct types of organism, the bacteria and the
archaea. The bacterial genome is localized within the nucleoid—the lightly
staining region of the otherwise featureless prokaryotic cell. The DNA is
attached to a core of binding proteins from which 40–50 supercoiled loops of
DNA radiate out into the cell. We know much less about the equivalent structures in archaea, but they are likely to be quite different as archaea possess
proteins similar to eukaryotic histones rather than the bacterial nucleoid proteins. The E. coli genome is a single, circular DNA molecule but some
prokaryotes have linear genomes and some have multipartite genomes made
up of two or more circular and/or linear molecules. In the more complex
cases it can be difficult to distinguish which molecules are genuine parts of
the genome and which are dispensable plasmids. Prokaryotic genomes are

Genomes Chapter 8

Summary

very compact, with little repetitive DNA. Many genes are organized into operons, the members of which are expressed together and which may have a
functional relationship. Gene number is related to genome size. The largest
genomes belong to free-living species found in the soil, an environment that
provides a broad range of physical and biological conditions to which these
species must be able to respond. The smallest genomes belong to species that
are obligate parasites, such as Mycoplasma genitalium, which has just 470
genes. Between 250 and 350 genes are thought to constitute the minimal set
required to specify a free-living cell. Studies of prokaryotic genomes have
complicated the species concept for these organisms, as the genomes of different strains of the same species often have very different gene contents, and
lateral gene transfer can occur between different species. Metagenomics, the
study of all the genomes in a habitat (such as seawater), is showing that a substantial proportion of the species that are present in a particular habitat have
never been identified. The genomes in the mitochondria and chloroplasts of
eukaryotic cells have prokaryotic features because they are descended from
free-living bacteria that formed a symbiotic association with the precursor of
the eukaryotic cell. Most mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes are circular, possibly multipartite, with a copy number of 1000–10,000 per cell.
Mitochondrial genomes vary in size from 6 to 2500 kb and contain 5–100
genes, including genes for mitochondrial rRNAs, tRNAs, and proteins such as
components of the respiratory complex. Chloroplast genomes are less variable, most being 100–200 kb in size with a similar set of some 200 genes, the
majority coding for functional RNAs and photosynthetic proteins.

The viruses are the last and simplest form of life whose genomes we will
investigate. In fact, viruses are so simple in biological terms that we have to
ask ourselves if they can really be thought of as living organisms. Doubts arise
partly because viruses are constructed along lines different from all other
forms of life—viruses are not cells—and partly because of the nature of the
virus life cycle. Viruses are obligate parasites of the most extreme kind: they
reproduce only within a host cell, and in order to replicate and express their
genomes they must subvert at least part of the host’s genetic machinery to

their own ends. Some viruses possess genes coding for their own DNA polymerase and RNA polymerase enzymes, but many depend on the host
enzymes for genome replication and transcription. All viruses make use of
the host’s ribosomes and translation apparatus for synthesis of the polypeptides that make up the protein coats of their progeny. This means that virus
genes must be matched to the host genetic system. Viruses are therefore quite
specific for particular organisms, and individual types cannot infect a broad
spectrum of species.
In this chapter we will also consider the mobile genetic elements that make
up a substantial part of the repetitive component of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. We link these elements with virus genomes because it has
become clear in recent years that at least some of these repetitive sequences
are derived from viruses, and are, in effect, viral genomes that have lost the
ability to escape from their host cell.

9.1 The Genomes of Bacteriophages and
Eukaryotic Viruses
There is a multitude of different types of virus but the ones that have received
most attention from geneticists are those that infect bacteria. These are called
bacteriophages and have been studied in great detail since the 1930s, when
the early molecular biologists, notably Max Delbrück, chose phages as convenient model organisms with which to study genes. We will follow the lead
taken by Delbrück and use bacteriophages as the starting point for our investigation of viral genomes.

9.1.1 Bacteriophage genomes
Bacteriophages are constructed from two basic components: protein and
nucleic acid. The protein forms a coat, or capsid, within which the nucleic
acid genome is contained. There are three basic capsid structures (Figure 9.1):
G

Icosahedral, in which the individual polypeptide subunits (protomers)
are arranged into a three-dimensional geometric structure that surrounds
the nucleic acid. Examples are MS2 phage, which infects Escherichia coli,
and PM2, which infects Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

G

Filamentous, or helical, in which the protomers are arranged in a helix,
producing a rod-shaped structure. The E. coli phage called M13 is an
example.

G

Head-and-tail, a combination of an icosahedral head, containing the
nucleic acid, attached to a filamentous tail and possibly additional structures that facilitate entry of the nucleic acid into the host cell. This is a
common structure possessed by, for example, the E. coli phages T4 and l,
and phage SPO1 of Bacillus subtilis.

Bacteriophage genomes have diverse structures and organizations
The term “nucleic acid” has to be used when referring to phage genomes
because in some cases these molecules are made of RNA. Viruses are the one
form of “life” that contradict the conclusion of Avery and his colleagues and
of Hershey and Chase that the genetic material is DNA (Section 1.1.1).
Phages and other viruses also break another rule: their genomes, whether of
DNA or RNA, can be single stranded as well as double stranded. A whole

The genome structure given is that in the phage capsid; some genomes exist in different forms within the host cell.

range of different genome structures is known among the phages, as summarized in Table 9.1. With most types of phage there is a single DNA or RNA
molecule that comprises the entire genome. However, this is not always the
case and a few RNA phages have segmented genomes, meaning that their
genes are carried by a number of different RNA molecules. The sizes of phage
genomes vary enormously, from about 1.6 kb for the smallest phages to over
150 kb for large ones such as T2, T4, and T6.
Bacteriophage genomes, being relatively small, were among the first to be
studied comprehensively by the rapid and efficient DNA sequencing methods that were developed in the late 1970s. Gene numbers vary from just three
in the case of MS2, to over 200 for the more complex head-and-tail phages
(see Table 9.1). The smaller phage genomes of course contain relatively few
genes, but these can be organized in a very complex manner. Phage fX174,
for example, manages to pack into its genome “extra” biological information,
as several of its genes overlap (Figure 9.2). These overlapping genes share
nucleotide sequences (gene B, for example, is contained entirely within gene
A) but code for different gene products, as the transcripts are translated from
different start positions and in different reading frames. Overlapping genes
are not uncommon in viruses. The larger phage genomes contain more
genes, reflecting the more complex capsid structures of these phages and a
dependence on a greater number of phage-encoded enzymes during the
infection cycle. The T4 genome, for example, includes some 50 genes
involved solely in construction of the phage capsid (Figure 9.3). Despite their
complexity, even these large phages still require at least some host-encoded
proteins and RNAs in order to carry through their infection cycles.

Replication strategies for bacteriophage genomes
Bacteriophages are classified into two groups according to their life cycle:
lytic and lysogenic. The fundamental difference between these groups is that
a lytic phage kills its host bacterium very soon after the initial infection,

whereas a lysogenic phage can remain quiescent within its host for a substantial period of time, even throughout numerous generations of the host cell.
These two life cycles are typified by two E. coli phages: the lytic (or virulent)

The T series of E. coli phages (T1 to T7) were the first to become available to
molecular geneticists and have been the subject of much study. Their lytic
infection cycle was first investigated in 1939 by Emory Ellis and Max
Delbrück, who added T4 phages to a culture of E. coli, waited 3 minutes for
the phages to attach to the bacteria, and then measured the number of
infected cells over a period of 60 minutes. Their results (Figure 9.4A) showed
that there is no change in the number of infected cells during the first 22 minutes of infection, this latent period being the time needed for the phages to
reproduce within their hosts. After 22 minutes the number of infected cells
started to increase, showing that lysis of the original hosts had occurred and
that the new phages that had been produced were now infecting other cells
in the culture. The molecular events occurring at the different stages of this
one-step growth curve are shown in Figure 9.4B. The initial event is attachment of the phage particle to a receptor protein on the outside of the bacterium. Different types of phage have different receptors: for example, for T4
the receptor is a protein called OmpC (“Omp” stands for “outer membrane
protein”), which is a type of porin, the proteins that form channels through
the outer cell membrane and facilitate the uptake of nutrients. After attachment, the phage injects its DNA genome into the cell through its tail structure. Immediately after entry of the phage DNA, the synthesis of host DNA,
RNA, and protein stops and transcription of the phage genome begins. Within
5 minutes the bacterial DNA molecule has depolymerized and the resulting
nucleotides are being utilized in replication of the T4 genome. After 12 minutes, new phage capsid proteins start to appear and the first complete phage
particles are assembled. Finally, at the end of the latent period, the cell bursts
and the new phages are released. A typical infection cycle produces 200 to 300
T4 phages per cell, all of which can go on to infect other bacteria.

Most phages can follow the lytic infection cycle but some, such as l, can also
pursue a lysogenic cycle. In Section 2.2.1, when we looked at the use of l
phages as cloning vectors, we discovered that during a lysogenic cycle the
phage genome becomes integrated into the host DNA. This occurs immediately after entry of the phage DNA into the cell, and results in a quiescent
form of the bacteriophage, called the prophage (Figure 9.5A). Integration
occurs by site-specific recombination (Section 17.2) between identical 15 bp
sequences present in the l and E. coli genomes. Note that this means that the
l genome always integrates at the same position within the E. coli DNA molecule. The integrated prophage can be retained in the host DNA molecule for
many cell generations, being replicated along with the bacterial genome and
passed with it to the daughter cells. However, the switch to the lytic mode of
infection occurs if the prophage is induced by any one of several chemical or
physical stimuli. Each of these appears to be linked to DNA damage, and possibly therefore signals the imminent death of the host by natural causes. In
response to these stimuli, a second recombination event excises the phage
genome from the host DNA, phage DNA replication begins, and phage coat
proteins are synthesized (Figure 9.5B). Eventually, the cell bursts and new l
phages are released. Lysogeny adds an additional level of complexity to the
phage life cycle, and ensures that the phage is able to adopt the particular
infection strategy best suited to the prevailing conditions.

9.1.2 The genomes of eukaryotic viruses
The capsids of eukaryotic viruses are either icosahedral or filamentous: the
head-and-tail structure is unique to bacteriophages. One distinct feature of
eukaryotic viruses, especially those with animal hosts, is that the capsid may
be surrounded by a lipid membrane, forming an additional component to the
virus structure (Figure 9.6). This membrane is derived from the host when the
new virus particle leaves the cell, and may subsequently be modified by
insertion of virus-specific proteins.

Structures and replication strategies for eukaryotic viral genomes
Eukaryotic viral genomes display a great variety of structures (Table 9.2). They
may be DNA or RNA, single or double stranded (or partly double stranded
with single-stranded regions), linear or circular, segmented or nonsegmented. For reasons that no one has ever understood, the vast majority of
plant viruses have RNA genomes. Genome sizes cover approximately the
same range as seen with phages, although the largest viral genomes (e.g., vaccinia virus at 240 kb) are rather bigger than the largest phage genomes.

Although most eukaryotic viruses follow only the lytic infection cycle, few
take over the host cell’s genetic machinery to the extent that a bacteriophage
does. Many viruses coexist with their host cells for long periods, possibly
years, with the host cell functions ceasing only toward the end of the infection cycle, when the virus progeny that have been stored in the cell are
released. Other viruses have infection cycles similar to M13 in E. coli (Section
4.1.1), continually synthesizing new virus particles that are extruded from
the cell. These long-term infections can occur even if the viral genome does
not integrate into the host DNA, but this does not mean that there are no
eukaryotic viruses equivalent to lysogenic bacteriophages. A number of DNA
and RNA viruses are able to integrate into the genomes of their hosts, sometimes with drastic effects on the host cell. The viral retroelements are examples of integrative eukaryotic viruses. Their replication pathways include a
novel step in which an RNA version of the genome is converted into DNA.
There are two kinds of viral retroelement: the retroviruses, whose capsids
contain the RNA version of the genome, and the pararetroviruses, whose
encapsidated genome is made of DNA. The ability of viral retroelements to
convert RNA into DNA was confirmed independently in 1970 by Howard
Temin and by David Baltimore. Working with cells infected with retroviruses,
both Temin and Baltimore isolated the enzyme, now called reverse transcriptase, which is capable of making a DNA copy of an RNA template (and
is of immense utility in the experimental study of genomes—Section 2.1.1).
The typical retroviral genome is a single-stranded RNA molecule, 6000–9000
nucleotides in length. After entry into the cell, the genome is copied into
double-stranded DNA by a few molecules of reverse transcriptase that the
virus carries in its capsid. The double-stranded version of the genome then
integrates into the host DNA (Figure 9.7). Unlike l, the retroviral genome has
no sequence similarity with its insertion site in the host DNA. Integration of
the viral genome into the host DNA is a prerequisite for expression of the
retrovirus genes. There are three of these, called gag, pol, and env
(Figure 9.8). Each codes for a polyprotein that is cleaved, after translation,
into two or more functional gene products. These products include the viral
coat proteins (from env) and the reverse transcriptase (from pol). The protein products combine with full-length RNA transcripts of the retroviral
genome to produce new virus particles.
The causative agents of AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) were
shown to be retroviruses in 1983–84. The first AIDS virus was isolated independently by two groups, led by Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo. This virus
is called human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV-1, and is responsible for the
most prevalent and pathogenic form of AIDS. A related virus, HIV-2, discovered by Montagnier in 1985, is less widespread and causes a milder form of the
disease. The HIVs attack certain types of lymphocyte in the bloodstream,
thereby depressing the immune response of the host. These lymphocytes
carry on their surfaces multiple copies of a protein called CD4, which acts as a
receptor for the virus. An HIV particle binds to a CD4 protein and then enters
the lymphocyte after fusion between its lipid envelope and the cell membrane.

Genomes at the edge of life

retrovirus. The capsid is surrounded by a

proteins are attached.

Viruses occupy the boundary between the living and nonliving worlds. At the
very edge of this boundary—or perhaps beyond it—reside a variety of nucleic
acid molecules that might or might not be classified as genomes. The satellite
RNAs or virusoids are examples. These are RNA molecules, some 320–400

nucleotides in length, which do not encode their own capsid proteins, instead
moving from cell to cell within the capsids of helper viruses. The distinction
between the two groups is that a satellite virus shares the capsid with the
genome of the helper virus whereas a virusoid RNA molecule becomes encapsidated on its own. They are generally looked on as parasites of their helper
viruses, although there appear to be at least a few cases where the helper cannot replicate without the satellite RNA or virusoid, suggesting that at least some
of the relationships are symbiotic. Satellite RNAs and virusoids are both found
predominantly in plants, as is a more extreme group called the viroids. These
are RNA molecules, 240–375 nucleotides in length, which contain no genes and
never become encapsidated, spreading from cell to cell as naked RNA. They
include some economically important pathogens, such as the citrus exocortis
viroid which reduces the growth of citrus fruit trees. Viroid and virusoid molecules are circular and single stranded and are replicated by enzymes coded by
the host or helper virus genomes. The replication process results in a series of
RNAs joined head to tail and, with some viroids and virusoids, these are cleaved

by a self-catalyzed reaction in which the RNA molecule acts as an enzyme
(Figure 9.9). We will study these RNA enzymes in greater detail in Section 12.2.4.
Nucleic acid molecules that replicate within plant cells can perhaps be
looked on as genomes even if they contain no genes. The same cannot be said
for prions, as these infectious, disease-causing particles contain no nucleic
acid. Prions are responsible for scrapie in sheep and goats and their transmission to cattle has led to the new disease called BSE—bovine spongiform
encephalopathy. Whether their further transmission to humans causes a variant form of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) is controversial but accepted by
many biologists. At first, prions were thought to be viruses but it is now clear
that they are made solely of protein. The normal version of the prion protein,
called PrPC, is coded by a mammalian nuclear gene and synthesized in the
brain, although its function is unknown. PrPC is easily digested by proteases
whereas the infectious version, PrPSC, has a more highly b-sheeted structure
that is resistant to proteases and forms fibrillar aggregates that are seen in
infected tissues. Once inside a cell, PrPSC molecules are able to convert newly
synthesized PrPC proteins into the infectious form, by a mechanism that is
not yet understood, resulting in the disease state. Transfer of one or more of
these PrPSC proteins to a new animal results in accumulation of new PrPSC
proteins in the brain of that animal, transmitting the disease (Figure 9.10).
Infectious proteins with similar properties are known in lower eukaryotes,
examples being the Ure3 and Psi+ prions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. It is
clear, however, that prions are gene products rather than genetic material and
despite their infectious properties, which led to the initial confusion regarding their status, they are unrelated to viruses or to subviral particles such as
viroids and virusoids.

In Chapters 7 and 8 we learnt that eukaryotic genomes, and to a lesser extent
those of prokaryotes, contain genome-wide or interspersed repeats, some
with copy numbers of several thousand per genome, with the individual
repeat units distributed in an apparently random fashion (Section 7.2.4). For
many interspersed repeats, the genome-wide distribution pattern is set up by
transposition, the process by which a segment of DNA can move from one
position to another in a genome. These movable segments are called transposable elements, or transposons. Some types move by a conservative
process, which involves the excision of the sequence from its original position
followed by its reinsertion elsewhere. Conservative transposition therefore
results in the transposon simply changing its position in the genome without
increasing its copy number (Figure 9.11). Replicative transposition, on the
other hand, results in an increase in copy number, because during this
process the original element remains in place while a copy is inserted at the
new position. This replicative process can therefore lead to a proliferation of
the transposon at interspersed positions around the genome.
Both types of transposition involve recombination, and we will therefore deal
with the details of the processes when we study recombination and related
types of genome rearrangement in Chapter 17. What interests us here is the
variety of structures displayed by the transposable elements found in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes, and the link that exists between these elements and viral genomes.

9.2.1 Transposition via an RNA intermediate
Replicative transposons can be further subdivided into those that transpose
via an RNA intermediate and those that do not. The process that involves an
RNA intermediate, which is called retrotransposition, begins with synthesis
of an RNA copy of the transposon by the normal process of transcription
(Figure 9.12). The transcript is then copied into double-stranded DNA, which
initially exists as an independent molecule outside of the genome. Finally, the
DNA copy of the transposon integrates into the genome, possibly back into
the same chromosome occupied by the original unit, or possibly into a different chromosome. The end result is that there are now two copies of the transposon, at different points in the genome.
If we compare the mechanism for retrotransposition with that for replication
of a viral retroelement, as shown in Figure 9.7, then we see that the two
processes are very similar, the one significant difference being that the RNA
molecule that initiates the process is transcribed from an endogenous genomic sequence during retrotransposition, and an exogenous viral genome
during replication of a viral retroelement. This close similarity alerts us to the
relationships that exist between these two types of element.

RNA transposons with long terminal repeats are related to viral
retroelements
RNA transposons, or retroelements, are features of eukaryotic genomes but
have not so far been discovered in prokaryotes. They can be broadly classified
into two types: those that possess long terminal repeats (LTRs) and those
that do not. Long terminal repeats, which play a central role in the process by
which the RNA copy of an LTR element is reverse transcribed into doublestranded DNA (Section 17.3.2), are also possessed by viral retroelements (see
Figure 9.8). It is now clear that these viruses are one member of a superfamily of elements that also includes endogenous LTR transposons. The first of
the endogenous elements to be discovered was the Ty sequence of yeast,
which is 6.3 kb in length and has a copy number of 25–35 in most
Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes—recall that one such element was present
in the 50 kb segment of the yeast genome that we examined in Section 7.2.2
(see Figure 7.15B). Yeast genomes also contain 100 or so additional copies of
the 330 bp LTRs of Ty elements, these solo “delta” sequences probably arising
by homologous recombination between the two LTRs of a Ty element, which
could excise the bulk of the element leaving a single LTR (Figure 9.13). This
excision event is probably unrelated to transposition of a Ty element, which
occurs by the RNA-mediated process shown in Figure 9.12.
There are several types of Ty element in yeast genomes. The most abundant
of these, Ty1, is similar to the copia retroelement of the fruit fly. These elements are therefore now called the Ty1/copia family. If we compare the structure of a Ty1/copia retrotelement with that of a viral retroelement, then we

see clear family relationships (Figure 9.14A and B). Each Ty1/copia element
contains two genes, called TyA and TyB in yeast, which are similar to the gag
and pol genes of a viral retroelement. In particular, TyB codes for a polyprotein that includes the reverse transcriptase that plays the central role in transposition of a Ty1/copia element. Note, however, that the Ty1/copia element
lacks an equivalent of the viral env gene, the one that codes for the viral coat
proteins. This means that Ty1/copia retroelements cannot form infectious
virus particles and therefore cannot escape from their host cell. They do,
however, form virus-like particles (VLPs) consisting of the RNA and DNA
copies of the retroelements attached to core proteins derived from the TyA
polyprotein. In contrast, the members of a second family of LTR retroelements, called Ty3/gypsy (again after the yeast and fruit fly versions), do have
an equivalent of the env gene (Figure 9.14C) and at least some of these can
form infectious viruses. Although classed as endogenous transposons, these
infectious versions should be looked upon as viral retroelements.
LTR retroelements make up substantial parts of many eukaryotic genomes,
and are particularly abundant in the larger plant genomes, especially those
of grasses such as maize (see Figure 7.15D). They also make up an important
component of invertebrate and some vertebrate genomes, but in the
genomes of humans and other mammals all the LTR elements appear to be
decayed viral retroelements rather than true transposons. These sequences
are called endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and with a copy number of
approximately 240,000 they make up 4.7% of the human genome (Table 9.3).
Human ERVs are 6–11 kb in length and have copies of the gag, pol, and env
genes. Although most contain mutations or deletions that inactivate one or
more of these genes, a few members of the human ERV group HERV-K have
functional sequences. By comparing the positions of the HERV-K elements
in the genomes of different individuals, it has been inferred that at least
some of these are active transposons. The majority of human ERVs are, however, inactive sequences that are not capable of additional proliferation.

RNA transposons that lack LTRs
Not all types of RNA transposon have LTR elements. In mammals the most
important types of nonLTR retroelements, or retroposons, are the LINEs
(long interspersed nuclear elements) and SINEs (short interspersed
nuclear elements). SINEs have the highest copy number for any type of interspersed repetitive DNA in the human genome, with over 1.7 million copies
comprising 14% of the genome as a whole (Table 9.3). LINEs are less frequent,
with just over 1 million copies, but as they are longer they make up a larger
fraction of the genome—over 20%. The abundance of LINEs and SINEs in the
human genome is underlined by their frequency in the 50 kb segment that we
looked at in Section 7.2.2 (see Figure 7.12).
There are three families of LINEs in the human genome, of which one group,
LINE-1, is both the most frequent and the only type that is able to transpose,
the LINE-2 and LINE-3 families being made up of inactive relics. A full-length
LINE-1 element is 6.1 kb and has two genes, one of which codes for a polyprotein similar to the product of the viral pol gene (Figure 9.15A). There are no
LTRs, but the 3¢ end of the LINE is marked by a series of A–T base pairs, giving what is usually referred to as a poly(A) sequence (though of course it is a
poly(T) sequence on the other strand of the DNA). Not all copies of LINE-1
are full length, because the reverse transcriptase coded by LINEs does not
always make a complete DNA copy of the initial RNA transcript, meaning that
part of the 3¢ end of the LINE may be lost. This truncation event is so common
that only 1% of the LINE-1 elements in the human genome are full-length
versions, with the average size of all the copies being just 900 bp. Although
LINE-1 transposition is a rare event, it has been observed in cultured cells and
appears to be responsible for hemophilia in some patients, due to movement
of a LINE-1 sequence into the factor VIII gene, disrupting the gene and hence
preventing synthesis of this important blood clotting protein.

Figure 9.15 NonLTR retroelements. Both
LINEs and SINEs have poly(A) sequences at
their 3¢ ends.

SINEs are much shorter than LINEs, being just 100–400 bp and not containing
any genes, which means that SINEs do not make their own reverse transcriptase enzymes (Figure 9.15B). Instead they “borrow” reverse transcriptases that
have been synthesized by LINEs. The commonest SINE in primate genomes is
Alu, which has a copy number of approximately 1.2 million in humans (Table
9.3). An Alu element comprises two halves, each half made up of a similar 120
bp sequence, with a 31–32 bp insertion in the right half (Figure 9.16). The
mouse genome has a related element, called B1, which is 130 bp in length and
equivalent to one half of an Alu sequence. Some Alu elements are actively
copied into RNA, providing the opportunity for proliferation of the element.
Alu is derived from the gene for the 7SL RNA, a noncoding RNA involved in
movement of proteins around the cell. The first Alu element may have arisen
by the accidental reverse transcription of a 7SL RNA molecule and integration
of the DNA copy into the human genome. Other SINEs are derived from tRNA
genes which, like the gene for the 7SL RNA, are transcribed by RNA polymerase III in eukaryotic cells (Section 11.2.1), suggesting that some feature of
the transcripts synthesized by this polymerase make these molecules prone
to occasional conversion into retroposons.

in a more direct DNA-to-DNA manner. In eukaryotes, these DNA transposons

are less common than retrotransposons, but they have a special place in
genetics because a family of plant DNA transposons—the Ac/Ds elements of
maize—were the first transposable elements to be discovered, by Barbara
McClintock in the 1950s. Her conclusions—that some genes are mobile and
can move from one position to another in a chromosome—were based on
exquisite genetic experiments, the molecular basis of transposition not being
understood until the late 1970s.

DNA transposons are common in prokaryotic genomes
DNA transposons are an important component of many prokaryotic
genomes. The insertion sequences, IS1 and IS186, present in the 50 kb segment of E. coli DNA that we examined in Section 8.2.1 (see Figure 8.7), are
examples of DNA transposons, and a single E. coli genome may contain as
many as 20 of these of various types. Most of the sequence of an IS is taken up
by one or two genes that specify the transposase enzyme that catalyzes its
transposition (Figure 9.17A). There are a pair of inverted repeats at either end
of each IS element, between 9 bp and 41 bp in length depending on the type
of IS, and insertion of the element into the target DNA creates a pair of short
(4–13 bp) direct repeats in the host genome. IS elements can transpose either
replicatively or conservatively.
IS elements are also components of a second type of DNA transposon first
characterized in E. coli and now known to be common in many prokaryotes.
These composite transposons are made up of a pair of IS elements flanking
a segment of DNA, usually containing one or more genes—often ones coding
for antibiotic resistance (Figure 9.17B). Tn10, for example, carries a gene for
tetracycline resistance, and Tn5 and Tn903 both carry a gene for resistance to

kanamycin. Some composite transposons have identical IS elements at either
end, and others have one element of one type and one of another. In some
cases the IS elements are orientated as direct repeats and sometimes as
inverted repeats. These variations do not appear to affect the transposition
mechanism for a composite transposon, which is conservative in nature and
catalyzed by the transposase coded by one or both of the IS elements.

Various other classes of DNA transposon are known in prokaryotes. Two additional important types from E. coli are:
G

Tn3-type transposons, which have their own transposase gene and so do
not require flanking IS elements in order to transpose (Figure 9.17C). Tn3
elements transpose replicatively.

G

Transposable phages, which are bacterial viruses that transpose replicatively as part of their normal infection cycle (Figure 9.17D).

DNA transposons are less common in eukaryotic genomes
The human genome contains approximately 350,000 DNA transposons of various types (Table 9.3), all with terminal inverted repeats and all containing a
gene for a transposase enzyme that catalyzes the transposition event. However,
the vast majority of these elements are inactive, either because the transposase
gene is nonfunctional or because sequences at the ends of the transposon,
which are essential for active transposition, are missing or mutated.
Active DNA transposons are more common in plants, and include the Ac/Ds
transposon, the first one to be discovered by McClintock, and the Spm element, both of which are found in maize. An interesting feature of these plant
transposons is that they work together in family groups. For example, the Ac
element codes for an active transposase that recognizes both Ac elements
and Ds sequences. The latter are versions of Ac that have internal deletions
that remove part of the transposase gene, meaning that a Ds element cannot

4.2 kb and contains a functional transposase
gene. The transposase recognizes the 11 bp
inverted repeats (IRs) at either end of the
Ac sequence and catalyzes its transposition.
The Ds element has an internal deletion
and so does not synthesize its own
transposase. But it still has the IR
sequences, which are recognized by the
transposase made by the Ac element.
Hence the Ds element is also able to
transpose. There are approximately ten
different types of Ds element in the maize
genome, with deletions ranging in size from
194 bp to several kilobases.

One possible explanation of hybrid
dysgenesis is that the cytoplasm of flies with
P elements (P+ in this diagram) contains a
repressor that prevents P element
transposition. The fertilized egg resulting
from a cross between a female P+ fly and
male P– fly will contain this repressor and so
the progeny are normal. However, the
repressor will not be carried in the sperm

in progeny displaying hybrid dysgenesis.

make its own transposase and can move only through the activity of the
transposase synthesized by a full-length Ac element (Figure 9.18). Similarly,
full-length Spm elements are accompanied by deleted versions which transpose through use of the transposase enzymes coded by the intact elements.
The activity of Ac elements is apparent during the normal life cycle of a
maize plant, transposition in somatic cells resulting in changes in gene
expression which are manifested in, for example, variegated pigmentation in
maize kernels (Figure 9.19).
McClintock’s realization that the maize genome contains transposable elements resulted from her studies into the genetic basis of the different color
patterns displayed by kernels. The P element, a DNA transposon in
Drosophila melanogaster, was similarly discovered from studies of an
unusual genetic event which, as it turns out, arises from transposition. This
event is called hybrid dysgenesis and occurs when females from laboratory
strains of D. melanogaster are crossed with males from wild populations. The
offspring resulting from such crosses are sterile and have chromosomal
abnormalities along with a variety of other genetic malfunctions. The explanation is that the genomes of wild fruit flies contain inactive versions of P elements—typical DNA transposons comprising a transposase gene flanked by
inverted terminal repeats—but that laboratory strains lack these elements.
After crossing, the elements inherited from the wild flies become active in the
fertilized eggs, transposing into various new positions and causing the gene
disruptions that characterize hybrid dysgenesis (Figure 9.20). Exactly why
this activation occurs is not known, but a more interesting question is why
the genomes of wild populations of D. melanogaster contain P elements
whereas laboratory strains do not. Most of the laboratory strains are
descended from flies collected by Thomas Hunt Morgan some 90 years ago,
and used by Morgan and his colleagues in the first gene mapping experiments (Section 3.2.3). It appears that wild populations at that time lacked P
elements, which have somehow proliferated in wild genomes during the last
90 years. The inability of wild and laboratory flies to produce viable offspring
means that these two populations fail one of the main criteria used to identify biological species—the ability of all individuals to mate productively. This
raises the intriguing possibility that speciation might, at least in some organisms, be driven by differential proliferation of transposable elements within
the genomes of members of different populations.

Summary
Early studies of viruses focused largely on the bacteriophages—viruses that
infect bacteria. Bacteriophages are constructed of protein and nucleic acid,
the protein forming a capsid that encloses the genome. There are three basic
types of capsid structure and many types of genome organization, different
phages having single- or double-stranded DNA or RNA genomes, some with
the entire genome contained in a single molecule, and some with segmented
genomes. Bacteriophages follow two distinct infection cycles. All phages can
infect via the lytic cycle, which results in the immediate synthesis of new bacteriophages, usually accompanied by death of the host cell. Some can also follow the lysogenic cycle, during which a copy of the phage genome becomes
inserted into the host DNA, where it may remain in quiescent form for many
cell generations. Eukaryotic viruses are equally diverse in terms in genome
organization but display just two capsid structures. Most eukaryotic viruses

Genomes Chapter 9

Summary

follow a lytic infection cycle but this does not always result in the immediate
death of the host cell. A number of DNA and RNA viruses can integrate their
genomes into eukaryotic chromosomes in a manner similar to a lysogenic
bacteriophage. The viral retroelements, which include HIV, the causative
agent of AIDS, are examples of integrative RNA viruses. Satellite RNAs and
virusoids are different types of infective RNA molecule that contain no genes
and depend on other viruses for their transmission. Viroids are small, infective
RNA molecules that never become encapsidated, and prions are infective
proteins. Some mobile genetic elements, which are DNA sequences that can
transpose within a genome but cannot escape from the cell, are related to
RNA viruses. These elements transpose via an RNA intermediate in a pathway
similar to the infection process of viral retroelements. The Ty1/copia and
Ty3/gypsy retroelements, and the endogenous retroviruses of mammals, are
the mobile elements most closely related to RNA viruses. Mammalian
genomes also contain other types of RNA transposon, called LINEs and SINEs,
most of which have lost their ability to transpose. DNA transposons do not
make use of an RNA intermediate in their transposition pathway. These transposons are common in bacteria, within which they are responsible for the
spread of genes coding for antibiotic resistance. DNA transposons are less
widespread in eukaryotes but include some important examples, such as the
Ac/Ds transposon of maize, the first transposon of any kind to be studied in
detail, and the P element of Drosophila melanogaster, which is responsible for
the hybrid dysgenesis that occurs when female laboratory fruit flies are
crossed with male wild flies.

PART

How Genomes Function

Chapter 10
Part 3 – How Genomes Function examines the
events that result in the transfer of biological information from genome to transcriptome to proteome. We begin with the genome itself and the
way in which chromatin structure influences the
overall pattern of genome expression (Chapter 10).
We then examine the structures of the transcription initiation complexes of eukaryotes and
prokaryotes, and investigate the ways in which
these structures are assembled (Chapter 11),
before moving on to the events responsible for synthesis and processing of the components of the
transcriptome (Chapter 12) and proteome
(Chapter 13). Finally, in Chapter 14, we survey the
various strategies that are used by cells to regulate
expression of their genomes, these strategies
enabling genome activity to be responsive to extracellular signals and enabling multicellular organisms to follow complex developmental pathways.

When you have read Chapter 10, you should be able to:
Explain how chromatin structure influences genome expression.
Describe the internal architecture of the eukaryotic nucleus.
Distinguish between the terms “constitutive heterochromatin,” “facultative heterochromatin,” and
“euchromatin.”
Discuss the key features of functional domains, insulators, and locus control regions, and describe
the experimental evidence supporting our current knowledge of these structures.
Give details of how histone acetylation and deacetylation are carried out and how these
modifications influence genome expression.
Describe the other types of chemical modification that can be made to histone proteins, and link
this information to the concept of the “histone code.”
State why nucleosome positioning is important in genome expression, and give details of protein
complexes involved in nucleosome remodeling.
Explain how DNA methylation is carried out and describe the importance of methylation in
silencing the genome.
Give details of the involvement of DNA methylation in genomic imprinting and X inactivation.

In order for the cell to utilize the biological information contained within its
genome, groups of genes, each gene representing a single unit of information,
have to be expressed in a coordinated manner. This coordinated gene expression determines the makeup of the transcriptome, which in turn specifies the
nature of the proteome and defines the activities that the cell is able to carry
out. In Part 3 of Genomes we examine the events that result in the transfer of
biological information from genome to proteome. Our knowledge of these
events was initially gained through studies of individual genes, often as
“naked” DNA in test-tube experiments. These experiments provided an interpretation of gene expression that in recent years has been embellished by

Genomes Chapter 10

Chapter 10 Accessing the Genome

more sophisticated studies that have taken greater account of the fact that, in
reality, it is the genome that is expressed, not individual genes, and this
expression occurs in living cells rather than in a test tube.
We begin our investigation of genome expression, here in Chapter 10, by
examining the substantial and important impact that the nuclear environment has on the utilization of the biological information contained in the
genomes of eukaryotes, the accessibility of that information being dependent
on the way in which the DNA is packaged into chromatin, and being responsive to processes that can silence or inactivate part or all of a chromosome.
Chapter 11 then describes the events involved in initiation of transcription,
and emphasizes further the critical role that DNA-binding proteins play during the early stages of genome expression. The synthesis of transcripts and
their subsequent processing into functional RNAs is dealt with in Chapter 12,
and Chapter 13 covers the equivalent events that lead to synthesis of the proteome. As you read Chapters 10–13, you will discover that control over the
composition of the transcriptome and of the proteome can be exerted at various stages during the overall chain of events that make up genome expression. These regulatory threads will be drawn together in Chapter 14, where we
examine how genome activity changes in response to extracellular signals
and during differentiation and development.

10.1 Inside the Nucleus
When one looks at a genome sequence written out as a series of As, Cs, Gs,
and Ts, or drawn as a map (as in Figure 7.12, for example), there is a tendency
to imagine that all parts of the genome are readily accessible to the DNAbinding proteins that are responsible for its expression. In reality, the situation is very different. The DNA in the nucleus of a eukaryotic cell or the
nucleoid of a prokaryote is attached to a variety of proteins that are not
directly involved in genome expression and which must be displaced in order
for the RNA polymerase and other expression proteins to gain access to the
genes. We know very little about these events in prokaryotes, a reflection of
our generally poor knowledge about the physical organization of the prokaryotic genome (Section 8.1.1), but we are beginning to understand how the
packaging of DNA into chromatin (Section 7.1.1) influences genome expression in eukaryotes. This is an exciting area of molecular biology, with recent
research indicating that histones and other packaging proteins are not simply
inert structures around which the DNA is wound, but instead are active participants in the processes that determine which parts of the genome are
expressed in an individual cell. Many of the discoveries in this area have been
driven by new insights into the substructure of the nucleus, and it is with this
topic that we begin the chapter.

10.1.1 The internal architecture of the eukaryotic nucleus
The internal architecture of the nucleus was first examined by light and electron microscopy. The apparent lack of structure that emerged from these
studies led to the view that the inside of the nucleus is relatively homogeneous, a typical “black box” in common parlance. In recent years this interpretation has been overthrown, and we now appreciate that the nucleus has
a complex internal structure that is related to the variety of biochemical activities that it must carry out. Indeed, the inside of the nucleus is just as complex
as the cytoplasm of the cell, the only difference being that, in contrast to the

cytoplasm, the functional compartments within the nucleus are not individually enclosed by membranes, and so are not visible when the cell is observed
using conventional light or electron microscopy techniques.

The nucleus has a highly ordered internal structure
This revised picture of nuclear structure has emerged from two novel types of
microscopic analysis. First, conventional electron microscopy has been supplemented by examination of mammalian cells that have been prepared in a
special way. After dissolution of membranes by soaking in a mild, nonionic
detergent such as one of the Tween compounds, followed by treatment with
a deoxyribonuclease to degrade the nuclear DNA, and salt extraction to
remove the chemically basic histone proteins, the nuclear substructure has
been revealed as a complex network of protein and RNA fibrils, called the
nuclear matrix (Figure 10.1A). The matrix permeates the entire nucleus and
includes regions defined as the chromosome scaffold, which changes its
structure during cell division, resulting in condensation of the chromosomes
into their metaphase forms (see Figure 7.4).
A second novel type of microscopy has involved the use of fluorescent labeling, designed specifically to reveal areas within the nucleus where particular
biochemical activities are occurring. The nucleolus (Figure 10.1B), which is
the center for synthesis and processing of rRNA molecules, has been recognized for many years as it is the one structure within the nucleus that can be
seen by conventional electron microscopy. Fluorescent labeling directed at
the proteins involved in RNA splicing (Section 12.2.2) has shown that this
activity is also localized into distinct regions (Figure 10.1C), although these
are more widely distributed and less-well defined than the nucleoli. Other
structures, such as Cajal bodies (visible in Figure 10.1B), which are probably
involved in synthesis of small nuclear RNAs (Section 12.2.2), are also seen
after fluorescent labeling.
The complexity of the nuclear matrix, as shown by Figure 10.1A, could be
taken as an indication that the nucleus has a static internal environment,
with limited movement of molecules from one site to another. Another new
microscopy technique, called fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP; Technical Note 10.1), which enables the movement of proteins within
the nucleus to be visualized, shows that this is not the case. The migration of
nuclear proteins does not occur as rapidly as would be expected if their
movement were totally unhindered, which is entirely expected in view of the
large amounts of DNA and RNA in the nucleus, but it is still possible for a protein to traverse the entire diameter of a nucleus in a matter of minutes.
Proteins involved in genome expression therefore have the freedom needed

Chapter 10 Accessing the Genome

Technical Note 10.1 Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)
Visualization of protein mobility in living nuclei
FRAP is perhaps the most informative of the various innovative microscopy techniques that have opened up our
understanding of nuclear substructure. It has enabled, for
the first time, the movement of proteins to be visualized
inside living nuclei, the resulting data allowing biophysical
models of protein dynamism to be tested.
The starting point for a FRAP experiment is a nucleus in
which every copy of the protein of interest carries a fluorescent tag. Labeling the protein molecules in vitro and then
reintroducing them into the nucleus is not possible, so the
host organism has to be genetically engineered so that the
fluorescent tag is an integral part of the protein that is synthesized in vivo. This is achieved by ligating the coding
sequence for the green fluorescent protein to the gene
for the protein being studied. Standard cloning techniques
are then used to insert the modified gene into the host
genome, leading to a recombinant cell that synthesizes a
fluorescent version of the protein. Observation of the cell

using a fluorescence microscope now reveals the distribution of the labeled protein within the nucleus.
To study the mobility of the protein, a small area of the
nucleus is photobleached by exposure to a tightly focused
pulse from a high-energy laser. The laser pulse inactivates
the fluorescent signal in the exposed area, leaving a region
that appears bleached in the microscopic image. This
bleached area gradually retrieves its fluorescent signal, not
by a reversal of the bleaching effect, but by migration into
the bleached region of fluorescent proteins from the unexposed area of the nucleus. Rapid reappearance of the fluorescent signal in the bleached area therefore indicates that
the tagged proteins are highly mobile, whereas a slow
recovery indicates that the proteins are relatively static. The
kinetics of signal recovery can be used to test theoretical
models of protein dynamism derived from biophysical
parameters such as binding constants and flux rates.

to move from one activity site to another, as dictated by the changing requirements of the cell. In particular, the linker histones (Section 7.1.1) continually
detach and reattach to their binding sites on the genome. This discovery is
important because it emphasizes that the DNA–protein complexes that make
up chromatin are dynamic, an observation that has considerable relevance to
genome expression, as we will discover later in this chapter.

Each chromosome has its own territory within the nucleus

(HSA 19) have been painted green and

Initially it was thought that chromosomes are distributed randomly within a
eukaryotic nucleus. We now know that this view is incorrect and that each
chromosome occupies its own space, or territory. These can be visualized by
chromosome painting, which is a version of fluorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH; Section 3.3.2) in which the hybridization probe is a mixture of DNA
molecules, each specific for different regions of a single chromosome. When
applied to interphase nuclei, chromosome painting reveals territories occupied by individual chromosomes (Figure 10.2). These territories take up the
majority of the space within the nucleus, but are separated from one another
by nonchromatin regions, within which the enzymes and other proteins
involved in expression of the genome are located.
Chromosome territories appear to be fairly static within an individual
nucleus. This has been concluded from experiments in which CENP-B proteins, components of the centromeres (Section 7.1.2), are labeled with green
fluorescent protein (see Technical Note 10.1) and the locations of these proteins, and hence of the centromeres, observed over a period of time. On the
whole, individual centromeres remain stationary throughout the cell cycle,
though there are occasional bursts of relatively slow movement. Although

Figure 10.3 Products of translocation between human chromosomes 9 and 22. The
normal human chromosomes 9 and 22 are shown on the left and the translocation products
are on the right. The Philadelphia chromosome is the smaller of the two translocation products.
Chromosomes 9 and 22 commonly break at the positions indicated. Often the breaks are
correctly repaired, but occasionally misrepair creates the hybrid products. It is thought that the
relatively high frequency with which the Philadelphia chromosome arises indicates that
chromosomes 9 and 22 occupy adjacent territories in the human nucleus. The chromosome 9
breakpoint lies within the ABL gene, the product of which is involved in cell signaling (Section
14.1.2). The translocation attaches a new coding sequence to the start of this gene, resulting in
an abnormal protein which causes cell transformation and gives rise to chronic myeloid leukemia.

fairly static during the lifetime of a cell, most studies suggest that the relative
positioning of territories is not retained after cell division, as different patterns are observed in the nuclei of the daughter cells. There may, however, be
certain constraints on territory locations, as it has been known for several
years that chromosome translocations, which result in a segment of one
chromosome becoming attached to another chromosome, are more frequent
between certain pairs than others. For example, a translocation between
human chromosomes 9 and 22, resulting in the abnormal product called the
Philadelphia chromosome, is a common cause of chronic myeloid leukemia
(Figure 10.3). The repeated occurrence of the same translocation suggests
that the territories of the interacting pair of chromosomes are frequently
close to one another in the nucleus. There is also evidence that, at least in
some organisms, certain chromosomes preferentially occupy territories close
to the periphery of the nucleus. Relatively little genome expression occurs in
this region, and it is often here that those chromosomes that contain few
active genes are found, examples being the macrochromosomes of the
chicken genome (Section 7.1.2).

The positioning of active genes within individual chromosome territories is a
further topic of debate. At one time it was thought that the active genes were
located on the surface of a territory, adjacent to the nonchromatin region and
hence within easy reach of the enzymes and proteins involved in gene transcription (Figure 10.4). This view is now being questioned, partly as a result of
experiments that have shown that RNA transcripts are distributed within territories as well as on their surfaces. More refined microscopic examination has
shown that channels run through chromosome territories, linking different
parts of the nonchromatin regions, and providing a means by which the transcription machinery can penetrate into the internal parts of these territories.

10.1.2 Chromatin domains
In Section 7.1.1 we learnt that chromatin is the complex of genomic DNA and
chromosomal proteins present in the eukaryotic nucleus. Chromatin structure is hierarchic, ranging from the two lowest levels of DNA packaging—the
nucleosome and the 30 nm chromatin fiber (see Figures 7.2 and 7.3)—to the
metaphase chromosomes, which represent the most compact form of chromatin in eukaryotes and occur only during nuclear division. After division,
the chromosomes become less compact and cannot be distinguished as individual structures unless specialized techniques such as chromosome painting are used. When nondividing nuclei are examined by light microscopy all
that can be seen is a mixture of light- and dark-staining areas within the
nucleus. The dark areas are called heterochromatin and contain DNA that is
still in a relatively compact organization, although less compact than in the
metaphase structure. Two types of heterochromatin are recognized:

view on the left shows the original model
with each territory forming a block, implying
that active genes are located on the surface
of a territory. The view on the right shows
the revised model, with channels running

Constitutive heterochromatin is a permanent feature of all cells and represents DNA that contains no genes and so can always be retained in a
compact organization. This fraction includes centromeric and telomeric
DNA, as well as certain regions of some other chromosomes. For example,
most of the human Y chromosome is made of constitutive heterochromatin (see Figure 7.5).

Facultative heterochromatin is not a permanent feature but is seen in
some cells some of the time. Facultative heterochromatin is thought to
contain genes that are inactive in some cells or at some periods of the cell
cycle. When these genes are inactive, their DNA regions are compacted
into heterochromatin.

fibrous, protein-based structure whose
precise composition and arrangement in the
nucleus has not been described.
Euchromatin, predominantly in the form of
the 30 nm chromatin fiber (see Figure 7.3),
is thought to be attached to the matrix by
AT-rich sequences called matrix-associated
regions or scaffold attachment regions
(MARs or SARs).

It is assumed that the organization of heterochromatin is so compact that
proteins involved in genome expression simply cannot access this type of
DNA. In contrast, the parts of the chromosomal DNA where the active genes
are located are less compact and permit entry of the expression proteins.
These regions are called euchromatin. The exact organization of the DNA
within euchromatin is not known, but with the electron microscope it is possible to see loops of DNA within the euchromatin regions, each loop between
40 kb and 100 kb in length and predominantly in the form of the 30 nm chromatin fiber. The loops are attached to the nuclear matrix via AT-rich DNA segments called matrix-associated regions (MARs), or scaffold attachment
regions (SARs) (Figure 10.5).
The loops of DNA between the nuclear matrix attachment points are called
structural domains. An intriguing question is the precise relationship
between these and the functional domains that can be discerned when the
region of DNA around an expressed gene or set of genes is examined. A functional domain is delineated by treating a region of purified chromatin with
deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) which, being a DNA-binding protein, cannot
gain access to the more compacted regions of DNA (Figure 10.6). Regions
sensitive to DNase I extend to either side of a gene or set of genes that is being
expressed, indicating that in this area the chromatin has a more open organization, although it is not clear whether this organization is the 30 nm fiber or
the “beads-on-a-string” structure (Figure 7.2A). Intuition suggests that there
should be a correspondence between structural and functional domains, and
this view is supported by the location of some MARs, which mark the limits of
a structural domain, at the boundary of a functional domain. But the correspondence does not seem to be complete because some structural domains
contain genes that are not expressed at the same time, and the boundaries of
some structural domains lie within genes.

Functional domains are defined by insulators
The boundaries of functional domains are marked by sequences, 1–2 kb in
length, called insulators. Insulator sequences were first discovered in
Drosophila and have now been identified in a range of eukaryotes. The best

Insulators display two special properties related to their role as the delimiters
of functional domains. The first is their ability to overcome the positional
effect that occurs during a gene-cloning experiment with a eukaryotic host.
The positional effect refers to the variability in gene expression that occurs
after a new gene has been inserted into a eukaryotic chromosome. It is
thought to result from the random nature of the insertion event, which could
deliver the gene to a region of highly packaged chromatin, where it will be
inactive, or into an area of open chromatin, where it will be expressed
(Figure 10.8A). The ability of scs and scs¢ to overcome the positional effect
was demonstrated by placing them either side of a fruit-fly gene for eye color.
When flanked by the insulators, this gene was always highly expressed when
inserted back into the Drosophila genome, in contrast to the variable expression that was seen when the gene was cloned without the insulators
(Figure 10.8B). The deduction from this and related experiments is that insulators can bring about modifications to chromatin packaging and hence
establish a functional domain when inserted into a new site in the genome.

Figure 10.7 Insulator sequences in the
fruit-fly genome. The diagram shows the
region of the Drosophila genome
containing the two hsp70 genes. The
insulator sequences scs and scs¢ are either
side of the gene pair. The arrows below the
two genes indicate that they lie on different
strands of the double helix and so are
transcribed in opposite directions.

Insulators also maintain the independence of each functional domain, preventing “cross-talk” between adjacent domains. If scs or scs¢ is excised from
its normal location and reinserted between a gene and the upstream regulatory modules that control expression of that gene, then the gene no longer
responds to its regulatory modules: it becomes “insulated” from their effects
(Figure 10.9A). This observation suggests that, in their normal positions, insulators prevent the genes within a domain from being influenced by the regulatory modules present in an adjacent domain (Figure 10.9B).
Figure 10.8 The positional effect. (A) A
cloned gene that is inserted into a region of
highly packaged chromatin will be inactive,
but one inserted into open chromatin will
be expressed. (B) The results of cloning
experiments without (red) and with (blue)
insulator sequences. When insulators are
absent, the expression level of the cloned
gene is variable, depending on whether it is
inserted into packaged or open chromatin.
When flanked by insulators, the expression
level is consistently high because the
insulators establish a functional domain at
the insertion site.

How insulators carry out their roles is not yet known but it is presumed that
the functional component is not the insulating sequence itself but the DNAbinding proteins, such as Su(Hw) in Drosophila, that attach specifically to
insulators. As well as binding to insulators, these proteins form associations
with the nuclear matrix, possibly indicating that the functional domains that
they define are also structural domains within the chromatin. This is an
attractive hypothesis that can be tied in with the ability of insulators to establish open chromatin regions and to prevent cross-talk between functional
domains, but it implies that insulators contain MAR sequences, which has
not been proven. An equivalence between functional and structural domains
therefore remains elusive.

Some functional domains contain locus control regions
The formation and maintenance of an open functional domain, at least for
some domains, is the job of a DNA sequence called the locus control region,
or LCR. Like insulators, an LCR can overcome the positional effect when
linked to a new gene that is inserted into a eukaryotic chromosome. Unlike
insulators, an LCR also stimulates the expression of genes contained within
its functional domain.

Figure 10.10 DNase I hypersensitive sites
indicate the position of the locus control
region for the human b-globin gene
cluster. A series of hypersensitive sites are
located in the 20 kb of DNA upstream of
the start of the b-globin gene cluster. These
sites mark the position of the locus control
region. Additional hypersensitive sites are
seen immediately upstream of each gene,
at the position where RNA polymerase
attaches to the DNA. These hypersensitive
sites are specific to different developmental
stages, being seen only during the phase of
development when the adjacent gene is
active. The 60 kb region shown here
represents the entire b-globin functional
domain. See Figure 7.19 for more
information on developmental regulation of
expession of the b-globin gene cluster.

LCRs were first discovered during a study of the human b-globin genes
(Section 7.2.3) and are now thought to be involved in expression of many
genes that are active in only some tissues or during certain developmental
stages. The globin LCR is contained in a stretch of DNA some 12 kb in length,
positioned upstream of the genes in the 60 kb b-globin functional domain
(Figure 10.10). The LCR was initially identified during studies of individuals
with thalassemia, a blood disease that results from defects in the a- or b-globin proteins. Many thalassemias result from mutations in the coding regions
of the globin genes, but a few were shown to map to a 12 kb region upstream
of the b-globin gene cluster, the region now called the LCR. The ability of
mutations in the LCR to cause thalassemia is a clear indication that disruption of the LCR results in a loss of globin gene expression.

More detailed study of the b-globin LCR has shown that it contains five separate DNase I hypersensitive sites, short regions of DNA that are cleaved by
DNase I more easily than other parts of the functional domain. These sites are
thought to coincide with positions where nucleosomes have been modified
or are absent and which are therefore accessible to binding proteins that
attach to the DNA. It is these proteins, not the DNA sequence of the LCR, that
control the chromatin structure within the functional domain. Exactly how,
and in response to what biochemical signals, is not known.
DNase I hypersensitive sites also occur immediately upstream of each of the
genes in the b-globin functional domain (see Figure 10.10) at the positions
where the transcription initiation complex is assembled on the DNA (Section
11.2.2). These assembly positions illustrate an interesting feature of DNase I
hypersensitive sites: they are not invariant components of a functional
domain. Recall that the different b-type globin genes are expressed at different stages of the human developmental cycle, e being active in the early
embryo, Gg and Ag in the fetus, and d and b in the adult (see Figure 7.19). Only
when the gene is active is its assembly position for the transcription initiation
complex marked by a hypersensitive site. Initially it was thought that this was
an effect of the differential expression of these genes; in other words, that in
the absence of gene activity it was possible for nucleosomes to cover the
assembly site, presumably to be pushed to one side when it became time to
express the gene. Now it is thought that the presence or absence of nucleosomes is a cause of gene expression, the gene being switched off if nucleosomes cover the assembly site, or switched on if access to the site is open.

10.2 Chromatin Modifications and
Genome Expression
The previous sections have introduced us to two ways in which chromatin
structure can influence genome expression (Figure 10.11):
G

The degree of chromatin packaging displayed by a segment of a chromosome determines whether or not genes within that segment are expressed.

G

If a gene is accessible, then its transcription is influenced by the precise
nature and positioning of the nucleosomes in the region where the transcription initiation complex will be assembled.

chromatin structure can influence gene
expression. A region of unpackaged
chromatin in which the genes are accessible
is flanked by two more-compact segments.
Within the unpackaged region, the
positioning of the nucleosomes influences
gene expression. On the left, the
nucleosomes have regular spacing, as
displayed by the typical “beads-on-a-string”
structure. On the right, the nucleosome
positioning has changed and a short stretch
of DNA, approximately 300 bp in length, is
exposed.

Significant advances in understanding both types of chromatin modification
have been made in recent years. We will begin with the processes that influence chromatin packaging.

10.2.1 Chemical modification of histones
Nucleosomes appear to be the primary determinants of genome activity in
eukaryotes, not only by virtue of their positioning on a strand of DNA, but
also because the precise chemical structure of the histone proteins contained
within nucleosomes is the major factor determining the degree of packaging
displayed by a segment of chromatin.

Acetylation of histones influences many nuclear activities including
genome expression
Histone proteins can undergo various types of modification, the best studied
of these being histone acetylation—the attachment of acetyl groups to lysine
amino acids in the N-terminal regions of each of the core molecules (Figure
10.12). These N termini form tails that protrude from the nucleosome core
octamer (Figure 10.13) and their acetylation reduces the affinity of the histones for DNA and possibly also reduces the interaction between individual

nucleosome core octamer. The view on

barrel-shaped octamer; the view on the right
is from the side. The two strands of the

nucleosomes, destabilizing the 30 nm chromatin fiber. The histones in heterochromatin are generally unacetylated whereas those in functional domains
are acetylated, a clear indication that this type of modification is linked to
DNA packaging.
The relevance of histone acetylation to genome expression was underlined in
1996 when, after several years of trying, the first examples of histone acetyltransferases (HATs)—the enzymes that add acetyl groups to histones—were
identified. It was realized that some proteins that had already been shown to
have important influences on genome expression had HAT activity. For example, one of the first HATs to be discovered, the Tetrahymena protein called
p55, was shown to be a homolog of a yeast protein, GCN5, which was known
to activate assembly of the transcription initiation complex (Section 11.3.2).
Similarly, the mammalian protein called p300/CBP, which had been ascribed
a clearly defined role in activation of a variety of genes, was found to be a HAT.
These observations, plus the demonstration that different types of cell display different patterns of histone acetylation, underline the prominent role
that histone acetylation plays in regulating genome expression.
Individual HATs can acetylate histones in the test tube but most have negligible activity on intact nucleosomes, indicating that, in the nucleus, HATs
almost certainly do not work independently, but instead form multiprotein
complexes, such as the SAGA and ADA complexes of yeast and the TFTC complex of humans. These complexes are typical of the large multiprotein structures that catalyze and regulate the various steps in genome expression,
many examples of which we will meet as we progress through the next few
chapters. SAGA, for example, comprises at least 15 proteins with a combined
molecular mass of 1.8 million. The complex is 18 ¥ 28 nm in size, which
means that it is larger than the nucleosome core octamer, which with its associated DNA is 11 ¥ 13 nm, and comparable in one dimension with the 30 nm
chromatin fiber. As well as GCN5—the protein with the HAT activity—the
SAGA complex contains a set of proteins related to the TATA-binding protein
(TBP), which initiates the process by which a gene is transcribed (Section
11.2.3), as well as five of the TBP-associated factors (TAFs) which help TBP
fulfill its role. The complexity of SAGA and the other HAT complexes, and the
presence within these complexes of proteins with distinct roles in the initiation of gene expression, indicates that the individual events that result in a
gene becoming active are intimately linked, with histone acetylation being an
integral part, but just one part, of the overall process.
There are at least five different families of HAT proteins. The GCN5-related
acetyltransferases, or GNATs, which are components of SAGA, ADA, and
TFTC, are clearly associated with activation of gene transcription, but also are
involved in the repair of some types of damaged DNA, in particular doublestrand breaks and lesions resulting from ultraviolet irradiation (Section
16.2.4). A second family of HATs, called MYST after the initial letters of four of
the proteins in this family, is similarly involved in transcription activation and
DNA repair, and has also been implicated in control of the cell cycle, though
this may simply be another aspect of the DNA repair function, as the cell cycle
stalls if the genome is extensively damaged (Section 15.3.2). Different complexes appear to acetylate different histones and some can also acetylate
other proteins involved in genome expression, such as the general transcription factors TFIIE and TFIIF, which we will meet in Section 11.2.3. HATs are

281

therefore emerging as versatile proteins that may have diverse functions in
expression, replication, and maintenance of the genome.

Histone deacetylation represses active regions of the genome
Gene activation must be reversible otherwise genes that become switched on
will remain permanently active. Hence it is no surprise that there is a set of
enzymes that can remove acetyl groups from histone tails, overturning the
transcription-activating effects of the HATs described above. This is the role
of the histone deacetylases (HDACs). The link between HDAC activity and
gene silencing was established in 1996, when mammalian HDAC1, the first of
these enzymes to be discovered, was shown to be related to the yeast protein
called Rpd3, which was known to be a repressor of transcription. The link
between histone deacetylation and repression of transcription was therefore
established in the same way as the link between acetylation and activation—
by showing that two proteins that were initially thought to have different
activities are in fact related. These are good examples of the value of homology analysis in studies of gene and protein function (Section 5.2.1).
HDACs, like HATs, are contained in multiprotein complexes. One of these is
the mammalian Sin3 complex, which comprises at least seven proteins,
including HDAC1 and HDAC2 along with others that do not have deacetylase
activity but which provide ancillary functions essential to the process.
Examples of ancillary proteins are RbAp46 and RbAp48, which are members
of the Sin3 complex and are thought to contribute the histone-binding capability. RbAp46 and RbAp48 were first recognized through their association
with the retinoblastoma protein, which controls cell proliferation by inhibiting expression of various genes until their activities are required and which,
when mutated, leads to cancer. This link between Sin3 and a protein implicated in cancer provides a powerful argument for the importance of histone
deacetylation in gene silencing. Other deacetylation complexes include
NuRD in mammals, which combines HDAC1 and HDAC2 with a different set
of ancillary proteins, and yeast Sir2, which is different from other HDACs in
that it has an energy requirement. The distinctive features of Sir2 show that
HDACs are more diverse than originally realized, possibly indicating that
novel roles for histone deacetylation are waiting to be discovered.
Studies of HDAC complexes are beginning to reveal links between the different mechanisms for genome activation and silencing. Both Sin3 and NuRD
contain proteins that bind to methylated DNA (Section 10.3.1), and NuRD
contains proteins that are very similar to components of the nucleosome
remodeling complex Swi/Snf (Section 10.2.2). NuRD does in fact act as a typical nucleosome remodeling machine in vitro. Further research will almost
certainly unveil additional links between what we currently look on as different types of chromatin modification system, but which in reality may simply
be different facets of a single grand design.

Acetylation is not the only type of histone modification
Lysine acetylation/deacetylation is the best-studied form of histone modification but it is by no means the only type. Three other kinds of covalent modification are known to occur:
G

Methylation of lysine and arginine residues in the N-terminal regions of
histones H3 and H4. Methylation was originally thought to be irreversible
and hence responsible for permanent changes to chromatin structure.

This view has been challenged by the discovery of enzymes that demethylate lysine and arginine residues, but it is still accepted that the effects of
methylation are relatively long term.
G

Phosphorylation of serine residues in the N-terminal regions of H2A, H2B,
H3, and H4.

G

Ubiquitination of lysine residues at the C termini of H2A and H2B. This
modification involves addition of the small, common (“ubiquitous”) protein called ubiquitin, or a related protein rather unhelpfully called SUMO.

As with acetylation, these other types of modification influence chromatin
structure and have a significant impact on cellular activity. For example,
phosphorylation of histone H3 and of the linker histone has been associated
with formation of metaphase chromosomes, and ubiquitination of histone
H2B is part of the general role that ubiquitin plays in control of the cell cycle.
The effects of methylation of a pair of lysine amino acids at the fourth and
ninth positions from the N terminus of histone H3 are particularly interesting. Methylation of lysine-9 forms a binding site for the HP1 protein, which
induces chromatin packaging and silences gene expression, but this event is
blocked by the presence of two or three methyl groups attached to lysine-4.
Methylation of lysine-4 therefore promotes an open chromatin structure and
is associated with active genes. Within the b-globin functional domain, and
probably elsewhere, lysine-4 methylation also prevents binding of the NuRD
deacetylase to histone H3, ensuring that this histone remains acetylated.
Lysine-4 methylation may therefore work hand-in-hand with histone acetylation to activate regions of chromatin.
Altogether, 29 sites in the N- and C-terminal regions of the four core histones
are known to be subject to covalent modification (Figure 10.14). Our growing
awareness of the variety of histone modifications that occur, and of the way
in which different modifications work together, has led to the suggestion that
there is a histone code, by which the pattern of chemical modifications specifies which regions of the genome are expressed at a particular time and dictates other aspects of genome biology, such as the repair of damaged sites
and coordination of genome replication with the cell cycle. This idea is still
unproven, but it is clear that the pattern of specific histone modifications
within the genome is linked closely to gene activity. Studies of human chromosomes 21 and 22, for example, have shown that regions within these chromosomes where lysine-4 of histone H3 is trimethylated and lysine-9 and
lysine-14 are acetylated correspond to the transcription start points for active
genes, and that dimethylated lysine-4 is also sometimes found in these
regions (Figure 10.15). As with all aspects of chromatin modification, the key
question is to distinguish cause and effect: are these patterns of histone modification the reason why these particular genes are active, or merely a byproduct of the processes responsible for their activation?

10.2.2 The influence of nucleosome remodeling on genome
expression

hsp70 gene

Activation by
GAGA

Figure 10.16 Activation of the hsp70
gene is associated with the creation of a
DNase I hypersensitive region. The
diagram shows nucleosomes, immediately
upstream of the start of the gene, being
repositioned when the gene is activated.

The second type of chromatin modification that can influence genome
expression is nucleosome remodeling. This term refers to the modification
or repositioning of nucleosomes within a short region of the genome, so that
DNA-binding proteins can gain access to their attachment sites. This does
not appear to be an essential requirement for transcription of all genes, and
in at least a few cases it is possible for a protein that switches on gene expression to achieve its effect either by binding to surfaces of nucleosomes or
somehow interacting with the linker DNA without affecting the nucleosome
positions. In other examples, repositioning of nucleosomes has been clearly
shown to be a prerequisite for gene activation. For example, transcription of
the hsp70 gene of Drosophila melanogaster, which codes for a protein
involved in folding other proteins (Section 13.3.1), is activated by the GAGA
protein in response to a heat shock. Activation is associated with the creation
of a DNase I hypersensitive region (Section 10.1.2) upstream of hsp70, a clear
indication that the nucleosomes in this area have been moved and a segment
of naked DNA exposed (Figure 10.16).
Unlike acetylation and the other chemical modifications described in the previous section, nucleosome remodeling does not involve covalent alterations to
histone molecules. Instead, remodeling is induced by an energy-dependent
process that weakens the contact between the nucleosome and the DNA with
which it is associated. Three distinct types of change can occur (Figure 10.17):

DNA Modification and Genome Expression

G

Remodeling, in the strict sense, involves a change in the structure of the
nucleosome, but no change in its position. The nature of the structural
change is not known, but when induced in vitro the outcome is a doubling
in size of the nucleosome and an increased DNase sensitivity of the
attached DNA.

G

Sliding, or cis-displacement, physically moves the nucleosome along the
DNA.

G

Transfer, or trans-displacement, results in the nucleosome being transferred to a second DNA molecule, or to a nonadjacent part of the same
molecule.

As with histone acetyltransferases, the proteins responsible for nucleosome
remodeling work together in large complexes. One of these is Swi/Snf, which
is made up of at least 11 proteins and is present in many eukaryotes. Little is
currently known about the way in which Swi/Snf, or any other nucleosome
remodeling complex, carries out its role in increasing access to the genome.
None of the components of Swi/Snf appears to have a DNA-binding capability, so the complex must be recruited to its target site by additional proteins.
Interactions have been detected between Swi/Snf and HATs, suggesting that
nucleosome remodeling might occur in conjunction with histone acetylation. This is an attractive hypothesis because it links the two activities that are
currently looked on as central to genome activation. But there are problems
with this hypothesis because Swi/Snf does not appear to have a global effect
across an entire genome, but instead influences gene expression at only a
limited number of positions: in the case of yeast, perhaps at no more than 6%
of all the genes in the genome. This observation suggests that the more
important interactions set up by Swi/Snf might not be with HATs, which work
throughout the genome, but with other proteins that target a limited set of
genes. The most likely candidates for these other proteins are transcription
activators (Section 11.3.2), each of which is specific for a small number of
genes and some of which form associations with Swi/Snf in vitro.

10.3 DNA Modification and Genome Expression
Important alterations in genome activity can also be achieved by making
chemical changes to the DNA itself. These changes are associated with the
semipermanent silencing of regions of the genome, possibly entire chromosomes, and often the modified state is inherited by the progeny arising from
cell division. The modifications are brought about by DNA methylation.

10.3.1 Genome silencing by DNA methylation
In eukaryotes, cytosine bases in chromosomal DNA molecules are sometimes
changed to 5-methylcytosine by the addition of methyl groups by enzymes
called DNA methyltransferases (see Figure 3.29). Cytosine methylation is relatively rare in lower eukaryotes but in vertebrates up to 10% of the total number of cytosine bases in a genome are methylated, and in plants the figure can
be as high as 30%. The methylation pattern is not random, instead being limited to the cytosine in some copies of the sequences 5¢–CG–3¢ and, in plants,
5¢–CNG–3¢. Two types of methylation activity have been distinguished (Figure
10.18). The first is maintenance methylation which, following genome replication, is responsible for adding methyl groups to the newly synthesized
strand of DNA at positions opposite methylated sites on the parent strand

(Section 16.2.3). The maintenance activity therefore ensures that the two
daughter DNA molecules retain the methylation pattern of the parent molecule, which means that the pattern can be inherited after cell division. The
second activity is de novo methylation, which adds methyl groups at totally
new positions and so changes the pattern of methylation in a localized region
of the genome.

Age of embryo (days)

Figure 10.19 Experimental evidence that
DNA methyltransferases 3a and 3b are
de novo methylases. The graph shows the
overall level of DNA methylation in normal
(wild type) mice embryos and in Dnmt3
knockouts. In normal embryos, the level of
DNA methylation increases due to de novo
methylation carried out by DNA
methyltransferases 3a and 3b, but in the
knockout embryos the level of DNA
methylation stays at its original level.

DNA methyltransferases have been extensively studied and are similar in all
organisms, from bacteria (which methylate their DNA to protect it from being
degraded by their restriction endonucleases, enabling these enzymes to be
directed at invading bacteriophage DNA) through to mammals such as
humans. Although a lot of work has been done on these enzymes, for several
years the apparent presence of only one DNA methyltransferase in mammalian cells was something of a puzzle. This enzyme, now called DNA
methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1), is responsible for maintenance methylation
but not de novo methylation, as knockout mice with inactivated Dnmt1 genes
are still capable of carrying out de novo methylation, as shown by their ability
to add methyl groups to the DNA genome of an infecting retrovirus. During
the late 1990s, by which time most of the genes in the human and mouse
genomes had become available as expressed sequence tags (Section 3.3.3),
searches of the relevant databases for homologs of Dnmt1 revealed two
genes—Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b—that are now known to code for the de novo
methyltransferases. Mice with these genes knocked out are unable to complete their full developmental pathways, those with an inactivated Dnmt3b
gene dying only a few days after birth, and those lacking Dnmt3a surviving
only 1–2 weeks longer. Analysis of methylation patterns in the DNA of
embryos during the period before death shows that in the knockouts the
extent of DNA methylation is only half that seen in normal mice (Figure
10.19), indicating that maintenance methylation, resulting from Dnmt1
activity, is occurring, but that de novo methylation is absent, and hence there
is no increase in the overall level of DNA methylation in these mice over time.
Both maintenance and de novo methylation result in repression of gene activity. This has been shown by experiments in which methylated or unmethylated genes have been introduced into cells by cloning and their expression
levels measured: expression does not occur if the DNA sequence is methylated. The link with gene expression is also apparent when the methylation
patterns in chromosomal DNAs are examined, these showing that active
genes are located in unmethylated regions. For example, in humans,
40%–50% of all genes are located close to CpG islands (Section 5.1.1), with the
methylation status of the CpG island reflecting the expression pattern of the
adjacent gene. Housekeeping genes—those that are expressed in all tissues—
have unmethylated CpG islands, whereas the CpG islands associated with tissue-specific genes are unmethylated only in those tissues in which the gene
is expressed. Note that because the methylation pattern is maintained after
cell division, information specifying which genes should be expressed is
inherited by the daughter cells, ensuring that in a differentiated tissue the
appropriate pattern of gene expression is retained even though the cells in
the tissue are being replaced and/or added to by new cells.
The importance of DNA methylation is underlined by studies of human diseases. The syndrome called ICF (immunodeficiency, centromere instability,

and facial anomalies) which, as the name suggests, has wide-ranging phenotypic effects, is associated with undermethylation of various genomic
regions, and is caused by a mutation in the gene for Dnmt3b. The opposing
situation—hypermethylation—is seen within the CpG islands of genes that
exhibit altered expression patterns in certain types of cancer, although in
these cases the abnormal methylation could equally well be a result rather
than the cause of the disease state.
How methylation influences genome expression was a puzzle for many years.
Now it is known that methyl-CpG-binding proteins (MeCPs) are components of both the Sin3 and NuRD histone deacetylase complexes. This discovery has led to a model in which methylated CpG islands are the target sites for
attachment of HDAC complexes that modify the surrounding chromatin in
order to silence the adjacent genes (Figure 10.20).

Methylation is involved in genomic imprinting and X inactivation
Further evidence, if it is needed, of the link between DNA methylation and
genome silencing is provided by two intriguing phenomena called genomic
imprinting and X inactivation.
Genomic imprinting is a relatively uncommon but important feature of
mammalian genomes in which only one of a pair of genes, present on homologous chromosomes in a diploid nucleus, is expressed, the second being
silenced by methylation. It also occurs in some insects (though apparently
not Drosophila melanogaster) and some plants. It is always the same member
of a pair of genes that is imprinted and hence inactive: for some genes this is
the version inherited from the mother, and for other genes it is the paternal
version. Just over 60 genes in humans and mice have been shown to display
imprinting, these including both protein-coding and functional RNA genes.
Imprinted genes are distributed around the genome but tend to occur in clusters. For example, in humans there is a 2.2 Mb segment of chromosome 15
within which there are at least ten imprinted genes, and a smaller, 1 Mb
region of chromosome 11 which contains eight imprinted genes.
An example of an imprinted gene in humans is Igf2, which codes for a growth
factor, a protein involved in signaling between cells (Section 14.1). Only the

KEY
Active gene

paternal gene is active (Figure 10.21), because on the chromosome inherited
from the mother, various segments of DNA in the region of Igf2 are methylated, preventing expression of this copy of the gene. A second imprinted
gene, H19, is located some 90 kb away from Igf2, but the imprinting is the
other way round: the maternal version of H19 is active and the paternal version is silent. Imprinting is controlled by imprint control elements, DNA
sequences that are found within a few kilobases of clusters of imprinted
genes. These centers mediate the methylation of the imprinted regions, but
the mechanism by which they do this has not yet been described in detail.
There is also uncertainty regarding the function of imprinting. One possibility
is that it has a role in development, because artificially created parthenogenetic mice, which have two copies of the maternal genome, fail to develop
properly. More subtle explanations based on the evolutionary conflicts between the males and females of a species have also been proposed.

X chromosome is present then no

chromosomes then two are inactivated. (B)
Three X chromosomes are inactivated in a
cell that has a diploid complement of
autosomes (AA) but four X chromosomes.
In contrast, only two X chromosomes are
inactivated if the cell is tetraploid (AAAA).

X inactivation is less enigmatic. This is a special form of imprinting that leads
to almost total inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in a female mammalian cell. It occurs because females have two X chromosomes whereas
males have only one. If both of the female X chromosomes were active then
proteins coded by genes on the X chromosome might be synthesized at twice
the rate in females compared with males. To avoid this undesirable state of
affairs, one of the female X chromosomes is silenced and is seen in the
nucleus as a condensed structure called the Barr body, which is comprised
entirely of heterochromatin. Most of the genes on the inactivated X chromosome become silenced but, for reasons that are unknown, some 20% escape
the process and remain functional.
Silencing occurs early in embryo development and is controlled by the X
inactivation center (Xic), a discrete region present on each X chromosome. In
a cell undergoing X inactivation, the inactivation center on one of the X chromosomes initiates the formation of heterochromatin, which spreads out
from the nucleation point until the entire chromosome is affected, with the
exception of a few short segments containing those genes that remain active.
The process takes several days to complete. The exact mechanism is not
understood but it involves, although is not entirely dependent upon, a gene
called Xist, located in the inactivation center, which is transcribed into a 25 kb
noncoding RNA, copies of which coat the chromosome as heterochromatin is
formed. At the same time various histone modifications occur. Lysine-9 of
histone H3 becomes methylated (recall that this modification is associated
with genome inactivation—Section 10.2.1), histone H4 becomes deacetylated
(as usually occurs in heterochromatin), and the histone H2A molecules are
replaced with a special histone, macroH2A1. Certain DNA sequences become
hypermethylated by DNA methyltransferase 3a, although this appears to
occur after the inactive state has been set up. X inactivation is heritable and
is displayed by all cells descended from the initial one within which the inactivation took place.
In a normal diploid female, one X chromosome is inactivated and the other
remains active. Remarkably, in diploid females with unusual sex chromosome
constitutions, the process still results in just a single X chromosome remaining active. For example, in those rare individuals that possess just a single X
chromosome no inactivation occurs, and in those individuals with an XXX
karyotype, two of the three X chromosomes are inactivated (Figure 10.22A).
This means that there must be a mechanism by which the X chromosomes in

Genomes Chapter 10

Summary

the nucleus are counted and the appropriate number inactivated. In fact, this
mechanism does not simply count the X chromosomes; it also counts the
autosomes and compares the two numbers. This is evident because if the cell
has four X chromosomes but is otherwise diploid then three X chromosomes
are inactivated, but if it is tetraploid (i.e., has four X chromosomes and also
four copies of each autosome) then two X chromosomes are inactivated
(Figure 10.22B). How the cell counts its chromosomes has puzzled cytogeneticists for many years, and continues to puzzle us, but the most recent research
suggests that two genes within the X inactivation center, called Tsix and Xite,
control the process, deletion or overexpression of one or both of these genes
causing an incorrect number of chromosomes to be inactivated.

Summary
The nuclear environment has a substantial and important impact on expression of the genome. A eukaryotic nucleus has a highly ordered internal structure which includes a complex network of protein and RNA fibrils called the
nuclear matrix. Each chromosome has its own territory within the nucleus,
these territories separated from one another by nonchromatin regions within
which the enzymes and other proteins involved in genome expression are
located. The most compact form of chromatin is heterochromatin, within
which genes are inaccessible and cannot be expressed. Constitutive heterochromatin is a permanent feature of all cells and represents DNA that contains no genes, whereas facultative heterochromatin is not permanent and is
thought to contain genes that are inactive in some tissues or at some stages of
the cell cycle. The more open type of chromatin, called euchromatin, is organized into loops attached to the nuclear matrix, the loops possibly corresponding to the functional domains into which the genes present in the genome
are organized. Each functional domain is delimited by a pair of insulators,
and some contain locus control regions that are involved in regulating expression of the genes contained in the domain. Nucleosomes appear to be the primary determinants of genome activity in eukaryotes, not only by virtue of
their positioning on a strand of DNA, but also because the precise chemical
structure of the histone proteins contained within nucleosomes is the major
factor determining the degree of packaging displayed by a segment of chromatin. Acetylation of lysine amino acids in the N-terminal regions of each of
the core histones is associated with activation of a region of the genome, and
deacetylation leads to genome silencing. Histones can also be modified by
methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination, each of these events having different, specific effects on the activity of adjacent genes. There may be a
histone code by which combinations of these various modifications are interpreted by the genome. Nucleosome repositioning is required for the expression of some, but not all, genes. Regions of the genome can be also silenced
by DNA methylation, the relevant enzymes possibly working in conjunction
with histone deacetylases. Methylation is responsible for genomic imprinting,
which results in one of a pair of genes on homologous chromosomes becoming silenced, and X inactivation, which leads to the almost complete inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in a female nucleus.

The initial product of genome expression is the transcriptome, the collection
of RNA molecules derived from those protein-coding genes whose biological
information is required by the cell at a particular time (see Figure 1.2). The
transcriptome is maintained by the process called transcription, in which
individual genes are copied into RNA molecules. Transcription was once
looked on simply as “DNA makes RNA,” and in essence this is what happens,

but we now realize that the process that leads from the genome to the transcriptome is much more complex than suggested by this trite statement. This
part of genome expression is now divided into two key stages (Figure 11.1):
G

Initiation of transcription, which results in assembly upstream of the gene
of the complex of proteins, including the RNA polymerase enzyme and its
various accessory proteins, that will subsequently copy the gene into an
RNA transcript. Inherent in this step are the events that determine whether
or not the gene is actually transcribed.

G

Synthesis and processing of RNA, which begins when the RNA polymerase
leaves the initiation region and starts to make an RNA copy of the gene,
and ends after completion of the processing and modification events that
convert the initial transcript into a mature RNA molecule, able to carry out
its function in the cell.

This chapter deals with the initiation of transcription, and Chapter 12 covers
RNA synthesis and processing. But before we move on to these topics we must
do a little groundwork. The central players in transcription are DNA-binding

proteins that attach to the genome in order to perform their biochemical
functions (see Table 11.1). Histones are examples of DNA-binding proteins,
and we will encounter many others later in this chapter when we look at
assembly of the initiation complexes of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. There are
also DNA-binding proteins that are involved in DNA replication, repair, and
recombination, as well as a large group of related proteins that bind to RNA
rather than DNA (see Table 11.1). Many DNA-binding proteins recognize specific nucleotide sequences and bind predominantly to these target sites,
whereas others bind nonspecifically at various positions in the genome.
The mode of action of DNA-binding proteins is central to the initiation of
transcription, and without a knowledge of how they function we can never
hope to understand how the information in the genome is utilized. We will
therefore spend some time examining what is known about DNA-binding
proteins and how they interact with the genome.

11.1 DNA-binding Proteins and Their
Attachment Sites
Our main interest lies with those proteins that are able to target a specific
nucleotide sequence and hence bind to a limited number of positions on a
DNA molecule, this being the type of interaction that is most important in
expression of the genome. To bind in this specific fashion, a protein must
make contact with the double helix in such a way that the nucleotide
sequence can be recognized, which generally requires that part of the protein
penetrates into the major and/or minor grooves of the helix (see Figures 1.8A
and 1.9) in order to achieve direct readout of the sequence (Section 11.1.3).
This is usually accompanied by more general interactions with the surface of
the DNA molecule, which may simply stabilize the DNA–protein complex or
which may access the indirect information on nucleotide sequence that is
provided by the conformation of the helix.

11.1.1 The special features of DNA-binding proteins
The structures of many proteins, including over 100 that bind to DNA or RNA,
have been determined by methods such as X-ray crystallography and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Technical Note 11.1).
When the structures of sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins are compared, it is immediately evident that the family as a whole can be divided into
a limited number of different groups on the basis of the structure of the segment of the protein that interacts with the DNA molecule (Table 11.2). Each
of these DNA-binding motifs is present in a range of proteins, often from very
different organisms, and at least some of them probably evolved more than
once. We will look at two in detail—the helix–turn–helix (HTH) motif and the
zinc finger—and then briefly survey the others.

The helix–turn–helix motif is present in prokaryotic and eukaryotic
proteins
The HTH motif was the first DNA-binding structure to be identified. As the
name suggests, the motif is made up of two a-helices separated by a turn
(Figure 11.2). The latter is not a random conformation but a specific structure,
referred to as a b-turn, made up of four amino acids, the second of which is
usually glycine. This turn, in conjunction with the first a-helix, positions the

Technical Note 11.1 X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
Methods for studying the structures of proteins and protein–nucleic acid complexes
Once a DNA- or RNA-binding protein has been purified,
attempts can be made to determine its structure, in isolation or attached to its binding site. This enables the precise
structure of the nucleic acid–binding part of the protein to
be determined, and allows the identity and nature of the
contacts with the DNA or RNA molecule to be elucidated.
Two techniques—X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy—are central to this
area of research.
X-ray crystallography, which is a long-established technique
whose pedigree stretches back to the late nineteenth century, is based on X-ray diffraction. X-rays have very short
wavelengths—between 0.01 nm and 10 nm—which is
4000 times shorter than visible light and comparable with
the spacings between atoms in chemical structures. When
(A) Production of a diffraction pattern

a beam of X-rays is directed onto a crystal, some of the
X-rays pass straight through, but others are diffracted and
emerge from the crystal at a different angle from which
they entered (Figure T11.1A). If the crystal is made up of
many copies of the same molecule, all positioned in a regular array, then different X-rays are diffracted in similar ways,
resulting in overlapping circles of diffracted waves which
interfere with one another. An X-ray-sensitive photographic

film or electronic detector placed across the beam reveals
a series of spots (Figure T11.1B), an X-ray diffraction pattern, from which the structure of the molecule in the crystal can be deduced. This is because the relative positioning
of the spots indicates the arrangement of the molecules in
the crystal, and their relative intensities provide information
on the structure of the molecule. The more complex the
molecule, the greater the number of spots and the larger
the number of comparisons that must be made between
them. Computational help is therefore required for all but
the simplest molecules. If successful, the result is an electron-density map (Figure T1C and D) which, with a protein,
provides a chart of the folded polypeptide from which the
positioning of structural features such as a-helices and bsheets can be determined. If sufficiently detailed, the R
groups of the individual amino acids in the polypeptide can
be identified and their orientations relative to one another
established, allowing deductions to be made about the
hydrogen bonding and other chemical interactions occurring within the protein structure. With luck, these deductions
lead to a detailed, three-dimensional model of the protein.
Like X-ray crystallography, NMR is a long-established technique that traces its origins to the early part of the twentieth century, first being described in 1936. The principle of
the technique is that rotation of a charged chemical nucleus
generates a magnetic moment. When placed in an applied
electromagnetic field, the spinning nucleus orientates in
one of two ways, called a and b (Figure T11.2), the a-orientation (which is aligned with the magnetic field) having a
slightly lower energy. In NMR spectroscopy the magnitude
of this energy separation is determined by measuring the
frequency of the electromagnetic radiation needed to
induce the transition from a to b, the value being described
as the resonance frequency of the nucleus being studied.
The critical point is that although each type of nucleus (e.g.,
1H, 13C, 15N) has its own specific resonance frequency, the
measured frequency is often slightly different from the standard value (typically by less than 10 parts per million)
because electrons in the vicinity of the rotating nucleus
shield it to a certain extent from the applied magnetic field.
This chemical shift (the difference between the observed
resonance energy and the standard value for the nucleus
being studied) enables the chemical environment of the
nucleus to be inferred, and hence provides structural information. Particular types of analysis (called COSY and
TOCSY) enable atoms linked by chemical bonds to the
spinning nucleus to be identified; other analyses (e.g.,
NOESY) identify atoms that are close to the spinning
nucleus in space but not directly connected to it. Not all

field. The energy separation between the a and b spin states is

chemical nuclei are suitable for NMR. Most protein NMR
projects are 1H studies, the aim being to identify the chemical environments and covalent linkages of every hydrogen
atom, and from this information to infer the overall structure of the protein. These studies are frequently supplemented by analyses of substituted proteins in which at least
some of the carbon and/or nitrogen atoms have been
replaced with the rare isotopes 13C and 15N, these also giving good results with NMR.
When successful, NMR results in the same level of resolution as X-ray crystallography and so provides very detailed
information on protein structure. The main advantage of
NMR is that it works with molecules in solution and so
avoids the problems that sometimes occur when attempting to obtain crystals of a protein for X-ray analysis. Solution
studies also offer greater flexibility if the aim is to examine
changes in protein structure, as occur during protein folding or in response to addition of a substrate. The disadvantage of NMR is that it is only suitable for relatively small
proteins. There are several reasons for this, one being the
need to identify the resonance frequencies for each, or as
many as possible, of the 1H or other nuclei being studied.
This depends on the various nuclei having different chemical shifts so that their frequencies do not overlap. The
larger the protein, the greater the number of nuclei and
the greater the chances that frequencies overlap and structural information is lost. Although this limits the applicability of NMR, the technique is still very valuable. There are
many interesting proteins that are small enough to be
studied by NMR, and important information can also be
obtained by structural analysis of peptides which, although
not complete proteins, can act as models for aspects of
protein activity such as nucleic acid binding.

second a-helix on the surface of the protein in an orientation that enables it to
fit inside the major groove of a DNA molecule. This second a-helix is therefore
the recognition helix that makes the vital contacts which enable the DNA
sequence to be read. The HTH structure is usually 20 or so amino acids in
length and so is just a small part of the protein as a whole. Some of the other
parts of the protein form attachments with the surface of the DNA molecule,
primarily to aid the correct positioning of the recognition helix within the
major groove.
Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins utilize an HTH motif.
In bacteria, HTH motifs are present in some of the best-studied regulatory proteins, which switch on and off the expression of individual genes. An example
is the lactose repressor, which regulates expression of the lactose operon
(Section 11.3.1). The various eukaryotic HTH proteins include many whose
DNA-binding properties are important in the developmental regulation of
genome expression, such as the homeodomain proteins, whose roles we will
examine in Section 14.3.4. The homeodomain is an extended HTH motif possessed by each of these proteins. It is made up of 60 amino acids which form
four a-helices, numbers 2 and 3 separated by a b-turn, with number 3 acting as
the recognition helix and number 1 making contacts within the minor groove
(Figure 11.3). Other versions of the HTH motif found in eukaryotes include:

Many proteins, prokaryotic and eukaryotic, possess an HTH motif, but the
details of the interaction of the recognition helix with the major groove are not
exactly the same in all cases. The length of the recognition helix varies, generally being longer in eukaryotic proteins, the orientation of the helix in the
major groove is not always the same, and the position within the recognition
helix of those amino acids that make contacts with nucleotides is different.

C

Zinc fingers are common in eukaryotic proteins
The second type of DNA-binding motif that we will look at in detail is the zinc
finger, which is rare in prokaryotic proteins but very common in eukaryotes.
There appear to be more than 500 different zinc-finger proteins in the worm
Caenorhabditis elegans, out of a total 19,000 proteins, and it is estimated that
1% of all mammalian genes code for zinc-finger proteins.
There are at least six different versions of the zinc finger. The first to be studied in detail was the Cys2His2 finger, which comprises a series of 12 or so
amino acids, including two cysteines and two histidines, which form a segment of b-sheet followed by an a-helix. These two structures, which form the
“finger” projecting from the surface of the protein, hold between them a
bound zinc atom, coordinated to the two cysteines and two histidines (Figure
11.4). The a-helix is the part of the motif that makes the critical contacts
within the major groove, its positioning within the groove being determined
by the b-sheet, which interacts with the sugar–phosphate backbone of the
DNA, and the zinc atom, which holds the b-sheet and a-helix in the appropriate positions relative to one another. Other versions of the zinc finger differ in
the structure of the finger, some lacking the b-sheet component and consisting simply of one or more a-helices, and the precise way in which the zinc
atom is held in place also varies. For example, the multicysteine zinc fingers
lack histidines, the zinc atom being coordinated between four cysteines.
An interesting feature of the zinc finger is that multiple copies of the finger are
sometimes found on a single protein. Several proteins have two, three, or four
fingers, but there are examples with many more than this—37 for one toad
protein. In most cases, the individual zinc fingers are thought to make independent contacts with the DNA molecule, but in some cases the relationship
between different fingers is more complex. In one particular group of proteins—the nuclear, or steroid, receptor family—two a-helices containing six
cysteines combine to coordinate two zinc atoms in a single DNA-binding
domain, larger than a standard zinc finger (Figure 11.5). Within this motif it
appears that one of the a-helices enters the major groove whereas the second
makes contacts with other proteins.

Other nucleic acid–binding motifs
The various other DNA-binding motifs that have been discovered in different
proteins include:

particular zinc finger is from the yeast SWI5
protein. The zinc atom is held between two
cysteines within the b-sheet of the motif

G

The basic domain, in which the DNA recognition structure is an a-helix
that contains a high number of basic amino acids (e.g., arginine, serine,
and threonine). A peculiarity of this motif is that the a-helix only forms
when the protein interacts with DNA: in the unbound state the helix has a
disorganized structure. Basic domains are found in a number of eukaryotic proteins involved in transcription of DNA into RNA.

G

The ribbon–helix–helix motif, which is one of the few motifs that achieves
sequence-specific DNA binding without making use of an a-helix as the
recognition structure. Instead, the ribbon (i.e., two strands of a b-sheet)
makes contact with the major groove (Figure 11.6). Ribbon–helix–helix
motifs are found in some gene-regulation proteins in bacteria.

G

The TBP domain, which has so far only been discovered in the TATAbinding protein (Section 11.2.3), after which it is named. As with the ribbon–helix–helix motif, the recognition structure is a b-sheet, but in this
case the main contacts are with the minor, not major, groove of the DNA
molecule.

RNA-binding proteins also have specific motifs that form the attachment
with the RNA molecule. The most important of these are as follows:

The drawing is of the ribbon–helix–helix
motif of the Escherichia coli MetJ repressor,
which consists of a dimer of two identical
proteins, one shown in gray and the other
in purple. The b-strands at the left of the
structure make contact with the major
groove of the double helix. “N” and “C”
indicate the N- and C-termini of the motif,
respectively.

G

The ribonucleoprotein (RNP) domain comprises four b-strands and two
a-helices in the order b–a–b–b–a–b. The two central b-strands make the
critical attachments with the RNA molecule. The RNP domain is the
commonest RNA-binding motif and has been found in more than 250
proteins.

G

The double-stranded RNA binding domain (dsRBD) is similar to the
RNP domain but has the structure a-b-b-b-a. The RNA-binding function
lies between the b-strand and a-helix at the end of the structure. As the
name implies, the motif is found in proteins that bind double-stranded
RNA.

G

The k-homology domain has the structure b-a-a-b-b-a, with the binding
function between the pair of a-helices. It is relatively uncommon but present in at least one nuclear RNA-binding protein.

Additionally, the DNA-binding homeodomain may also have RNA-binding
activity in some proteins. One ribosomal protein uses a structure similar to
a homeodomain to attach to rRNA, and some homeodomain proteins such
as Bicoid of Drosophila melanogaster (Section 14.3.4) can bind both DNA
and RNA.

a genome

Figure 11.7 Attachment sites for DNAbinding proteins are located immediately

Often the first thing that is discovered about a DNA-binding protein is not the
identity of the protein itself but the features of the DNA sequence that the protein recognizes. This is because genetic and molecular biology experiments,
which we will deal with later in this chapter, have shown that many of the proteins that are involved in genome expression bind to short DNA sequences
immediately upstream of the genes on which they act (Figure 11.7). This
means that the sequence of a newly discovered gene, assuming that it
includes both the coding DNA and the regions upstream of it, provides immediate access to the binding sites of at least some of the proteins responsible for
expression of that gene. Because of this, a number of methods have been

Genomes Chapter 11

DNA-Binding Proteins and Their Attachment Sites

Restriction
fragments

developed for locating protein-binding sites within DNA fragments up to several kilobases in length, these methods working perfectly well even if the relevant DNA-binding proteins have not been identified.

Gel retardation identifies DNA fragments that bind to proteins
The first of these methods makes use of the substantial difference between
the electrophoretic properties of a “naked” DNA fragment and one that carries a bound protein. Recall that DNA fragments are separated by agarose gel
electrophoresis because smaller fragments migrate through the pore-like
structure of the gel more quickly than larger fragments (see Technical Note
2.2). If a DNA fragment has a protein bound to it then its mobility through the
gel will be impeded: the DNA–protein complex therefore forms a band at a
position nearer to the starting point (Figure 11.8). This is called gel retardation. In practice the technique is carried out with a collection of restriction
fragments that span the region thought to contain a protein-binding site. The
digest is mixed with an extract of nuclear proteins (assuming that a eukaryote
is being studied) and retarded fragments are identified by comparing the
banding pattern obtained after electrophoresis with the pattern for restricted
fragments that have not been mixed with proteins. A nuclear extract is used
because at this stage of the project the DNA-binding protein has not usually
been purified. If, however, the protein is available then the experiment can be
carried out just as easily with the pure protein as with a mixed extract.

Protection assays pinpoint binding sites with greater accuracy
Gel retardation gives a general indication of the location of a protein-binding
site in a DNA sequence, but does not pinpoint the site with great accuracy.
Often the retarded fragment is several hundred base pairs in length, compared with the expected length of the binding site of a few tens of base pairs
at most, and there is no indication of where in the retarded fragment the
binding site lies. Also, if the retarded fragment is long then it might contain
separate binding sites for several proteins, or if it is quite small then there is
the possibility that the binding site also includes nucleotides on adjacent
fragments, ones that on their own do not form a stable complex with the protein and so do not lead to gel retardation. Gel retardation studies are therefore
a starting point but other techniques are needed to provide more accurate
information.
Modification protection assays can take over where gel retardation leaves off.
The basis of these techniques is that if a DNA molecule carries a bound protein then part of its nucleotide sequence will be protected from modification.
There are two ways of carrying out the modification:
G

By treatment with a nuclease, which cleaves all phosphodiester bonds
except those protected by the bound protein.

G

By exposure to a methylating agent, such as dimethyl sulfate which adds
methyl groups to G nucleotides. Any Gs protected by the bound protein
will not be methylated.

The practical details of these two techniques are shown in Figures 11.9 and
11.10. Both utilize an experimental approach called footprinting. In nuclease
footprinting, the DNA fragment being examined is labeled at one end, complexed with binding protein (as a nuclear extract or as pure protein), and
treated with deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I). Normally, DNase I cleaves every

nuclear extract has been mixed with a DNA

restriction fragments. The DNA–protein
complex has a larger molecular mass than
the “naked” DNA and so runs more slowly
during gel electrophoresis. As a result, the
band for this fragment is retarded and can
be recognized by comparison with the
banding pattern produced by restriction
fragments that have not been mixed with
the nuclear extract.

restriction fragments used at the start of the
procedure must be labeled at just one end.
This is usually achieved by treating a set of
longer restriction fragments with an enzyme
that attaches labels at both ends, then
cutting these labeled molecules with a
second restriction enzyme, and purifying
one of the sets of end fragments. The
DNase I treatment is carried out in the
presence of a manganese salt, which
induces the enzyme to make random,
double-stranded cuts in the target
molecules, leaving blunt-ended fragments.

phosphodiester bond, leaving only the DNA segment protected by the binding protein. This is not very useful because it can be difficult to sequence such
a small fragment. It is quicker to use the more subtle approach shown in
Figure 11.9. The nuclease treatment is carried out under limiting conditions,
such as a low temperature and/or very little enzyme, so that on average each
copy of the DNA fragment suffers a single “hit”—meaning that it is cleaved at
just one position along its length. Although each fragment is cut just once, in
the entire population of fragments all bonds are cleaved except those protected by the bound protein. The protein is now removed, the mixture electrophoresed, and the labeled fragments visualized. Each of these fragments
has the label at one end and a cleavage site at the other. The result is a ladder
of bands corresponding to fragments that differ in length by one nucleotide,
with the ladder broken by a blank area in which no labeled bands occur. This
blank area, or “footprint,” corresponds to the positions of the protected phosphodiester bonds, and hence of the bound protein, in the starting DNA.

Modification interference identifies nucleotides central
to protein binding
Modification protection should not be confused with modification interference, a different technique that provides an extra dimension to the study of
protein binding. Modification interference works on the basis that if a
nucleotide critical for protein binding is altered, for example by addition of a
methyl group, then binding may be prevented. One of this family of techniques is illustrated in Figure 11.11. The DNA fragment, labeled at one end, is
treated with the modification reagent, in this case dimethyl sulfate, under

limiting conditions so that just one guanine per fragment is methylated. Now
the binding protein or nuclear extract is added, and the fragments electrophoresed. Two bands are seen, one corresponding to the DNA–protein
complex and one containing DNA without bound protein. The latter contains
molecules that have been prevented from attaching to the protein because the
methylation treatment has modified one or more Gs that are crucial for the
binding. To identify which Gs are modified, the fragment is purified from the
gel and treated with piperidine, the compound that cleaves DNA at methylguanine nucleotides. The result of this treatment is that each fragment is cut
into two segments, one of which carries the label. The length(s) of the labeled
segment(s), determined by a second round of electrophoresis, tells us which
nucleotide(s) in the original fragment were methylated and hence identifies
the positions in the DNA sequence of Gs that participate in the binding reaction. Equivalent techniques can be used to identify the A, C, and T nucleotides
involved in binding.

11.1.3 The interaction between DNA and its binding proteins
In recent years, our understanding of the part played by the DNA molecule in
the interaction with a binding protein has begun to change. It has always been
accepted that proteins that recognize a specific sequence as their binding site

modification protection assay. The
technique is similar to DNase I footprinting.
Instead of DNase I digestion, the fragments
are treated with limited amounts of DMS so
that a single guanine base is methylated in
each fragment. Guanines that are protected
by the bound protein cannot be modified.
After removal of the protein, the DNA is
treated with piperidine, which cuts at the
modified nucleotide positions. For simplicity,
the diagram shows the double-stranded
molecules being cleaved at this stage. In
fact, they are only nicked, as piperidine only
cuts the strand that is modified, rather than
making a double-stranded cut across the
entire molecule. The samples are therefore
examined by denaturing gel electrophoresis
so that the two strands are separated. The
resulting autoradiograph shows the sizes of
the strands that have one labeled end and
one end created by piperidine nicking. The
banding pattern for the control DNA
strands—those not incubated with the
nuclear extract—indicates the positions of
guanines (Gs) in the restriction fragment,
and the footprint seen in the banding
pattern for the test sample shows which Gs
were protected.

can locate this site by forming contacts with chemical groups attached to the
bases that are exposed within the major and minor grooves that spiral around
the double helix (see Figure 1.8). It is now recognized that the nucleotide
sequence also influences the precise conformation of each region of the helix,
and that these conformational features represent a second, less direct way in
which the DNA sequence can influence protein binding.

the procedure used to obtain DNA
fragments labeled at just one end.

It was clear from the double helix structure described by Watson and Crick
(Section 1.1.2) that although the nucleotide bases are on the inside of the
DNA molecule, they are not entirely buried, and some of the chemical groups
attached to the purine and pyrimidine bases are accessible from outside the
helix. Direct readout of the nucleotide sequence should therefore be possible
without breaking the base pairs and opening up the molecule.
In order to form chemical bonds with groups attached to the nucleotide
bases, a binding protein must make contacts within one or both of the
grooves on the surface of the helix. With the B-form of DNA, the identity and
orientation of the exposed parts of the bases within the major groove is such
that most sequences can be read unambiguously, whereas within the minor
groove it is possible to identify if each base pair is A–T or G–C but difficult to
know which nucleotide of the pair is in which strand of the helix
(Figure 11.12). Direct readout of the B-form therefore predominantly involves
contacts in the major groove. With other DNA types there is much less information on the contacts formed with binding proteins, but the picture is likely
to be quite different. In the A-form, for example, the major groove is deep and
narrow and less easily penetrated by any part of a protein molecule (see
Table 1.1). The shallower minor groove is therefore likely to play the main part
in direct readout. With Z-DNA, the major groove is virtually nonexistent and
direct readout is possible to a certain extent without moving beyond the surface of the helix.

The nucleotide sequence has a number of indirect effects on
helix structure
Originally it was thought that cellular DNA molecules have fairly uniform
structures, made up mainly of the B-form of the double helix. Some short
segments might be in the A-form, and there might be some Z-DNA tracts,
especially near the ends of a molecule, but the majority of the length of a
double helix would be unvarying B-DNA. We now recognize that DNA is
much more polymorphic, and that it is possible for the A-, B-, and Z-DNA
configurations, and intermediates between them, to coexist within a single
DNA molecule, different parts of the molecule having different structures.
These conformational variations are sequence dependent, being largely the
result of the base-stacking interactions that occur between adjacent base
pairs. As well as being responsible, along with base pairing, for the stability
of the helix, the base stacking also influences the amount of rotation that
occurs around the covalent bonds within individual nucleotides and hence
determines the conformation of the helix at a particular position. The rotational possibilities in one base pair are influenced, via the base-stacking
interactions, by the identities of the neighboring base pairs. This means that
the nucleotide sequence indirectly affects the overall conformation of the
helix, possibly providing structural information that a binding protein can
use to help it locate its appropriate attachment site on a DNA molecule. At

DNA-Binding Proteins and Their Attachment Sites

present this is just a theoretical possibility as no protein that specifically recognizes a non-B-form of the helix has been identified, but many researchers
believe that helix conformation is likely to play some role in the interaction
between DNA and protein.
A second type of conformational change is DNA bending. This does not refer
to the natural flexibility of DNA, which enables it to form circles and supercoils, but instead to localized positions where the nucleotide sequence causes
the DNA to bend. Like other conformational variations, DNA bending is
sequence dependent. In particular, a DNA molecule in which one polynucleotide contains two or more groups of repeated adenines—each group
comprising 3–5 As, with the individual groups separated by 10 or 11 nucleotides—will bend at the 3¢ end of the adenine-rich region. As with helix conformation, it is not yet known to what extent DNA bending influences protein
binding, although protein-induced bending at flexible sites has a clearly
demonstrated function in the regulation of some genes (Section 11.3.2).

Contacts between DNA and proteins
The contacts formed between DNA and its binding proteins are noncovalent.
Within the major groove, hydrogen bonds form between the nucleotide
bases and the R groups of amino acids in the recognition structure of the
protein, whereas in the minor groove hydrophobic interactions are more
important. On the surface of the DNA helix, the major interactions are electrostatic, between the negative charges on the phosphate component of each
nucleotide and the positive charges on the R groups of amino acids such as
lysine and arginine, although some hydrogen bonding also occurs. In some
cases, hydrogen bonding on the surface of the helix or in the major groove is
direct between DNA and protein; in others it is mediated by water molecules.
Few generalizations can be made: at this level of DNA–protein interaction
each example has its own unique features and the details of the bonding
have to be worked out by structural studies rather than by comparisons with
other proteins.
Most proteins that recognize specific nucleotide sequences are also able to
bind nonspecifically to other parts of a DNA molecule. In fact, it has been suggested that the amount of DNA in a cell is so large, and the numbers of each
DNA-binding protein so small, that the proteins spend most, if not all, of their
time attached nonspecifically to DNA. The distinction between the nonspecific and specific forms of binding is that the latter is more favorable in thermodynamic terms. As a result, a protein is able to bind to its specific site even
though there are literally millions of other sites to which it could attach nonspecifically. To achieve this thermodynamic favorability, the specific binding
process must involve the greatest possible number of DNA–protein contacts,
which explains in part why the recognition structures of many DNA-binding
motifs have evolved to fit snugly into the major groove of the helix, where the
opportunity for DNA–protein contacts is greatest. It also explains why some
DNA–protein interactions result in conformational changes to one or other
partner, increasing still further the complementarity of the interacting surfaces, and allowing additional bonding to occur.
The need to maximize contacts in order to ensure specificity is also one of the
reasons why many DNA-binding proteins are dimers, consisting of two proteins attached to one another. This is the case for most HTH proteins and

time it was believed that this is not possible

present, and these are symmetric. Using
these two features, the binding protein

know which nucleotide is in which strand of

many of the zinc-finger type. Dimerization occurs in such a way that the DNAbinding motifs of the two proteins are both able to access the helix, possibly
with some degree of cooperativity between them, so that the resulting number of contacts is greater than twice the number achievable by a monomer. As
well as their DNA-binding motifs, many proteins contain additional characteristic domains that participate in the protein–protein contacts that result in
dimer formation. One of these is the leucine zipper, which is an a-helix that
coils more tightly than normal and presents a series of leucines on one of its
faces. These can form contacts with the leucines of the zipper on a second
protein, forming the dimer (Figure 11.13). A second dimerization domain is,
rather unfortunately, called the helix–loop–helix motif, which is distinct from,
and should not be confused with, the helix–turn–helix DNA-binding motif.

Figure 11.13 A leucine zipper. This is a
bZIP type of leucine zipper. The red and
orange structures are parts of different
proteins. Each set of spheres represents the
R group of a leucine amino acid. Leucines
in the two helices associate with one
another via hydrophobic interactions to hold
the two proteins together in a dimer. In this
example, the dimerization helices are
extended to form a pair of basic domain
DNA-binding motifs, shown making contacts
in the major groove.

An intriguing question is whether the specificity of DNA binding can be
understood in sufficient detail for the sequence of a protein’s target site to be
predicted from examination of the structure of the recognition helix of a
DNA-binding motif. To date, this objective has largely eluded us, but it has
been possible to deduce some rules for the interaction involving certain types
of zinc finger. In these proteins, four amino acids—three in the recognition
helix and one immediately adjacent to it—form critical attachments with the
nucleotide bases of the target site. Some of these attachments involve a single amino acid with a single base, others involve two amino acids with one
base. By comparing the sequences of amino acids in the recognition helices
of different zinc fingers with the sequences of nucleotides at the binding sites,
it has been possible to identify a set of rules governing the interaction. These
enable the nucleotide sequence specificity of a new zinc-finger protein to be
predicted, admittedly with the possibility of some ambiguity, once the amino
acid composition of its recognition helix is known.

11.2 DNA–Protein Interactions During
Transcription Initiation
Now that we have established that DNA–protein interactions are the key to
understanding the initiation of transcription, we can move on to begin our
examination of the events involved in the assembly of the initiation complex.
We will do this in two stages. First, we will study the DNA–protein interactions
that are involved in transcription initiation. Then, in Section 11.3, we will
investigate how assembly of the initiation complex, and its ability to initiate
transcription, can be controlled by various additional proteins that respond
to stimuli from inside or outside the cell and ensure that the correct genes are
transcribed at the appropriate times.

11.2.1 RNA polymerases
In Section 1.2.1 we learnt that the enzymes responsible for transcription of
DNA into RNA are called DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. Transcription of
eukaryotic nuclear genes requires three different RNA polymerases: RNA
polymerase I, RNA polymerase II, and RNA polymerase III. Each is a multisubunit protein (8–12 subunits) with a molecular mass in excess of 500 kDa.
Structurally, these polymerases are quite similar to one another, the three
largest subunits being closely related and some of the smaller ones being
found in more than one enzyme; functionally, however, they are quite
distinct. Each works on a different set of genes, with no interchangeability

as this is the enzyme that transcribes genes that code for proteins. It also
works on a set of genes specifying the snRNAs that are involved in RNA processing, and with the genes for the miRNAs. RNA polymerase III transcribes
other genes for small RNAs, including those for tRNAs. RNA polymerase I
transcribes the multicopy repeat units containing the 28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNA
genes. The functions of all these RNAs were summarized in Section 1.2.2 and
are described in detail in Chapters 12 and 13.
Archaea possess a single RNA polymerase that is structurally very similar to
the eukaryotic enzymes. But this is not typical of the prokaryotes in general
because the bacterial RNA polymerase is very different, consisting of just five
subunits, with its composition described as a2bb¢s (two a subunits, one each
of b and the related b¢, and one of s). The a, b, and b¢ subunits are equivalent
to the three largest subunits of the eukaryotic RNA polymerases, but the s
subunit has its own special properties, both in terms of its structure and, as
we will see in the next section, its function. An RNA polymerase very similar
to the bacterial enzyme is also found in chloroplasts, reflecting the bacterial
origins of these organelles (Section 8.3.1). Interestingly, however, the mitochondrial RNA polymerase, which consists of a single subunit with a molecular mass of 140 kDa, is more closely related to the RNA polymerases of certain bacteriophages than it is to the standard bacterial version.

11.2.2 Recognition sequences for transcription initiation
It is essential that transcription initiation complexes are constructed at the
correct positions on DNA molecules. These positions are marked by target
sequences that are recognized either by the RNA polymerase itself or by a
DNA-binding protein which, once attached to the DNA, forms a platform
onto which the RNA polymerase binds (see Figure 11.14).

(B) Indirect attachment of RNA polymerase

RNA polymerase

Bacterial RNA polymerases bind to promoter sequences
In bacteria, the target sequence for RNA polymerase attachment is called the
promoter. This term was first used by geneticists in 1964 to describe the function of a locus immediately upstream of the three genes in the lactose operon
(Figure 11.15). When this locus was inactivated by mutation, the genes in the
operon were not expressed; the locus therefore appeared to promote expression of the genes. We now know that this is because the locus is the binding
site for the RNA polymerase that transcribes the operon.
The sequences that make up the Escherichia coli promoter were first identified by comparing the regions upstream of over 100 genes. It was assumed
that promoter sequences would be very similar for all genes and so should be
recognizable when the upstream regions were compared. These analyses

nucleotides, described as follows (see Figure 11.15):

These are consensus sequences and so describe the “average” of all promoter
sequences in E. coli: the actual sequences upstream of any particular gene
might be slightly different (Table 11.4). The names of the boxes indicate their
positions relative to the point at which transcription begins. The nucleotide
at this point is labeled “+1” and is anything between 20 and 600 nucleotides
upstream of the start of the coding region of the gene. The spacing between
the two boxes is important because it places the two motifs on the same face
of the double helix, facilitating their interaction with the DNA-binding component of the RNA polymerase (Section 11.2.3).

Eukaryotic promoters are more complex
In eukaryotes, the term “promoter” is used to describe all the sequences that
are important in initiation of transcription of a gene. For some genes these
sequences can be numerous and diverse in their functions, including not
only the core promoter, sometimes called the basal promoter, which is the
site at which the initiation complex is assembled, but also one or more
upstream promoter elements which, as their name implies, lie upstream of
the core promoter. Assembly of the initiation complex on the core promoter
can usually occur in the absence of the upstream elements, but only in an
inefficient way. This indicates that the proteins that bind to the upstream elements include at least some that are activators of transcription, and which
therefore “promote” gene expression. Inclusion of these sequences in the
“promoter” is therefore justified.
Each of the three eukaryotic RNA polymerases recognizes a different type of
promoter sequence; indeed, it is the difference between the promoters that
defines which genes are transcribed by which polymerases. The details for
vertebrates are as follows (Figure 11.16):

G

RNA polymerase II promoters are variable and can stretch for several kilobases upstream of the transcription start site. The core promoter consists
of two main segments: the –25 or TATA box (consensus 5¢–TATAWAAR–3¢,
where W is A or T, and R is A or G) and the initiator (Inr) sequence (mammalian consensus 5¢–YCANTYY–3¢, where Y is C or T, and N is any nucleotide) located around nucleotide +1. Some genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II have only one of these two components of the core promoter,
and some, surprisingly, have neither. The latter are called “null” genes.
They are still transcribed, although the start position for transcription is
more variable than for a gene with a TATA box and/or Inr sequence. A few
genes have additional sequences that are sometimes looked on as part of
the core promoter. Examples are:
•

The downstream promoter element (DPE; located at positions +28 to
+32), which has a variable sequence but has been identified through its
ability to bind TFIID, a protein complex that plays a central role in the
preinitiation complex (Section 11.2.3).

•

A 7 bp GC-rich motif immediately upstream of the TATA box, which is
recognized by TFIIB, another component of the preinitiation complex.

•

The proximal sequence element (PSE), which is located between positions –45 and –60 upstream of those snRNA genes that are transcribed
by RNA polymerase II.

As well as the components of the core promoter, genes transcribed by RNA
polymerase II have various upstream promoter elements, the functions of
which are described in Section 11.3.2.
G

RNA polymerase III promoters are variable, falling into at least three categories. Two of these categories are unusual in that the important
sequences are located within the genes whose transcription they promote. Usually these sequences span 50–100 bp and comprise two conserved boxes separated by a variable region. The third category of RNA
polymerase III promoter is similar to those for RNA polymerase II, having
a TATA box and a range of additional promoter elements (sometimes
including the PSE mentioned above) located upstream of the target gene.
Interestingly, this arrangement is seen with the U6 gene, which is the single snRNA gene transcribed by RNA polymerase III, all the other snRNA
genes being transcribed by RNA polymerase II.

11.2.3 Assembly of the transcription initiation complex
In a general sense, initiation of transcription operates along the same lines
with each of the four types of RNA polymerase that we have been considering
(Figure 11.17). The bacterial polymerase and the three eukaryotic enzymes all
begin by attaching, directly or via accessory proteins, to their promoter or
core promoter sequences. Next, this closed promoter complex is converted
into an open promoter complex by breakage of a limited number of base
pairs around the transcription initiation site. Finally, the RNA polymerase
moves away from the promoter. This last step is more complicated than it
might appear because some attempts by the polymerase to achieve promoter
clearance are unsuccessful and lead to truncated transcripts that are
degraded soon after they are synthesized. The true completion of the initiation stage of transcription is therefore the establishment of a stable transcription complex that is actively transcribing the gene to which it is attached.
Although the scheme shown in Figure 11.17 is correct in outline for all four
RNA polymerases, the details are different for each one. We will begin with the
more straightforward events occurring in E. coli and other bacteria, and then
move on to the ramifications of transcription initiation in eukaryotes.

Transcription initiation in E. coli

RNA

Figure 11.17 Generalized scheme for the
events occurring during initiation of
transcription. The core promoter is shown
in green and the transcription initiation site
is indicated by a red dot. After RNA
polymerase attachment, the closed complex
is converted into the open complex by
breakage of base pairs within a short region
of the DNA double helix. RNA synthesis
begins but successful initiation is not
achieved until the polymerase moves away
from the promoter region.

In E. coli, a direct contact is formed between the promoter and RNA polymerase. The sequence specificity of the polymerase resides in its s subunit:
the “core enzyme,” which lacks this component, can only make loose and
nonspecific attachments to DNA.
Mutational studies of E. coli promoters have shown that changes to the
sequence of the –35 box affect the ability of RNA polymerase to bind, whereas
changes to the –10 box affect the conversion of the closed promoter complex
into the open form. These results led to the model for E. coli transcription initiation shown in Figure 11.18, where recognition of the promoter occurs by an
interaction between the s subunit and the –35 box, forming a closed promoter complex in which the RNA polymerase spans some 80 bp from
upstream of the –35 box to downstream of the –10 box. The closed promoter
complex is converted to the open form by the combined action of the b¢ and
s subunits, which break the base pairs within the –10 box. The model is consistent with the fact that the –10 boxes of different promoters are comprised
mainly or entirely of A–T base pairs, which are weaker than G–C pairs, being
linked by just two hydrogen bonds as opposed to three (see Figure 1.8B).
Opening up of the helix involves contacts between the polymerase and the
non-template strand (i.e., the one that is not copied into RNA), again with the
s subunit playing a central role. However, the s subunit is not all-important
because it usually (but not always) dissociates soon after initiation is complete, converting the holoenzyme (a2bb¢s) to the core enzyme (a2bb¢) which
carries out the elongation phase of transcription (Section 12.1.1). Initially the
core enzyme covers some 60 bp of the DNA, but soon after the start of elongation the polymerase undergoes a second conformational change, reducing
its footprint to just 30–40 bp.

DNA–Protein Interactions During Transcription Initiation

will show us that eukaryotic transcription initiation involves more proteins
and has added complexities.
The first difference between initiation of transcription in E. coli and eukaryotes is that eukaryotic RNA polymerases do not directly recognize their core
promoter sequences. For genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II, the initial
contact is made by the general transcription factor (GTF) TFIID, which is a
complex made up of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and at least 12 TBPassociated factors, or TAFs. TBP is a sequence-specific protein that binds to
DNA via its unusual TBP domain (Section 11.1.1), which makes contact with
the minor groove in the region of the TATA box. X-ray crystallography studies
of TBP show that it has a saddle-like shape that wraps partially around the
double helix, forming a platform onto which the remainder of the initiation
complex can be assembled (Figure 11.19).
The TAFs assist in attachment of TBP to the TATA box and, in conjunction
with other proteins called TAF- and initiator-dependent cofactors (TICs),
possibly also participate in recognition of the Inr sequence, especially at
those promoters that lack a TATA box. TAFs are intriguing proteins that
appear to play a variety of roles during initiation of transcription and also
during other events that involve assembly of multiprotein complexes onto
the genome. Five of the yeast TAFs are also present in SAGA, one of the histone acetyltransferase complexes that we met in Section 10.2.1, and TAF1 of
Drosophila melanogaster possesses a kinase activity that enables it to phosphorylate serine-33 of histone H2B, activating expression of adjacent genes
(Section 10.2.1). TAFs have also been implicated in control of the cell cycle in
various eukaryotes and in regulation of the developmental changes that
result in formation of gametes in animals. A clue as to how TAFs carry out
their multifarious roles has been provided by structural studies which have
shown that at least three of them contain a histone fold—a non-sequencespecific DNA-binding motif, comprising a long a-helix flanked on either side
by two shorter a-helices, that is a characteristic feature of histones (see Table
11.2). In the complex formed between TAFII42 and TAFII62, the two histone
folds are orientated in almost exactly the same way as in the histone H3/H4
dimer found in the central tetramer of the nucleosome core particle (Figure
11.20). It has been proposed that these TAFs might be able to form a DNAbinding structure resembling a nucleosome, this pseudonucleosome acting
as the platform for assembly of the initiation complex. The idea is attractive
but more research is needed to determine if the similarities between TAFs
and histones extend to the details of the attachment between the initiation
complex and its DNA target. TAFs lack certain amino acids that are looked on
as essential for stabilizing the contacts between real nucleosomes and DNA,
and the similarities could simply reflect an equivalence in the protein–protein interactions within the initiation complex and the nucleosome, rather
than being directly relevant to DNA attachment.
After TBP has attached to the core promoter, the preinitiation complex (PIC)
is formed by recruitment of additional GTFs, whose roles are summarized in
Table 11.5. TBP binding induces formation of a bend of approximately 80˚ in
the DNA, widening the minor groove in the region of the TATA box (Figure
11.21). TFIIB now attaches to the complex, this attachment involving contacts with the TATA box via the widened minor groove and, via the major
groove, with the TFIIB recognition motif immediately upstream of the TATA

box (Section 11.2.2). These attachments ensure the correct positioning, relative to the transcription start site, of RNA polymerase II, which is brought into
the complex by TFIIF. The preinitiation complex is completed by addition of
TFIIE and TFIIH, the latter of which has a helicase activity and is thought to
disrupt the DNA base pairing and hence to convert the promoter into the
open form. TFIIH is an interesting protein as it also has a role in DNA repair,
some types of which are coupled with transcription, and we will encounter it
again when we study DNA repair mechanisms in Section 16.2.2.

Activation of the initiation complex requires the addition of phosphate

in each repeat unit can be modified by addition of a phosphate group, causing a substantial change in the ionic properties of the polymerase. Once phosphorylated, the polymerase is able to leave the initiation complex and begin

synthesizing RNA. Phosphorylation might be carried out by TFIIH, which has
the appropriate protein kinase capability, or it might be the function of the
mediator (Section 11.3.2), which transduces signals from activator proteins
that regulate expression of individual genes. After departure of the polymerase, at least some of the GTFs detach from the core promoter, but TFIID,
TFIIA, and TFIIH remain, enabling reinitiation to occur without the need to
rebuild the entire assembly from the beginning. Reinitiation is therefore a
more rapid process than primary initiation, which means that once a gene is
switched on, transcripts can be initiated from its promoter with relative ease
until such a time as a new set of signals switches the gene off.

Transcription initiation with RNA polymerases I and III
Initiation of transcription at RNA polymerase I and III promoters involves
similar events to those seen with RNA polymerase II, but the details are different. One of the most striking similarities is that TBP, first identified as the
key sequence-specific DNA-binding component of the RNA polymerase II
preinitiation complex, is also involved in initiation of transcription by the two
other eukaryotic RNA polymerases.
The RNA polymerase I initiation complex involves four protein complexes in
addition to the polymerase itself. One of these, UBF, is a dimer of identical
proteins that interacts with both the core promoter and the upstream control
element (see Figure 11.16). UBF is another protein which, like some of the
RNA polymerase II TAFs, resembles a histone and may form a nucleosomelike structure in the promoter region. A second protein complex, called SL1 in
humans and TIFIB in mice, contains TBP and, together with UBF, directs RNA
polymerase I and the last two complexes, TIFIA and TIFIC, to the promoter.
Originally it was thought that the initiation complex was built up in a stepwise fashion, but recent results suggest that RNA polymerase I binds the four
protein complexes before promoter recognition, the entire assembly attaching to the DNA in a single step.
RNA polymerase III promoters are variable in structure (see Figure 11.16)
and this is reflected by a nonuniformity of the processes through which they
are recognized. Initiation at the different categories of RNA polymerase III
promoter requires different sets of GTFs, but each type of initiation process
involves TFIIIB, one of whose subunits is TBP. With promoters of the type
seen with the U6 snRNA gene, which contain a TATA sequence, TBP probably binds directly to the DNA. At those RNA polymerase III promoters that
lie within genes, and which have no TATA sequence, binding of TBP is via a
pair of assembly factors called TFIIIA and TFIIIC. The name “assembly factor” indicates that these two proteins are needed only for attachment of TBP
to the promoter and are not essential for the subsequent binding of RNA
polymerase III.

11.3 Regulation of Transcription Initiation
As we progress through the next few chapters we will encounter a number of
strategies that organisms use to regulate expression of individual genes. We
will discover that virtually every step in the pathway from genome to proteome is subject to some degree of control. Of all these regulatory systems, it
appears that transcription initiation is the stage at which the critical controls
over the expression of individual genes (i.e., those controls that have greatest

this scheme, “primary” regulation of

relative rates of expression of those genes

involves all steps in the genome expression
pathway after transcription initiation, and
serves to modulate the amount of protein
that is synthesized or to change the nature
of the protein in some way, for example by
chemical modification.

impact on the biochemical properties of the cell) are exerted. This is perfectly
understandable. It makes sense that transcription initiation, being the first
step in genome expression, should be the stage at which “primary” regulation
occurs, this being the level of regulation that determines which genes are
expressed. Later steps in the pathway might be expected to respond to “secondary” regulation, the function of which is not to switch genes on or off but
to modulate expression by making small changes to the rate at which the protein product is synthesized, or possibly by changing the nature of the product
in some way (Figure 11.22).
In Chapter 10 we looked at how chromatin structure can influence gene
expression by controlling the accessibility of promoter sequences to RNA
polymerase and its associated proteins. This is just one way in which initiation of transcription can be regulated. To obtain a broader picture, we will
establish some general principles with bacteria, and then examine the events
in eukaryotes.

11.3.1 Strategies for controlling transcription initiation
in bacteria
In bacteria such as E. coli, we recognize two distinct ways in which transcription initiation is controlled:
G

Constitutive control, which depends on the structure of the promoter.

G

Regulatory control, which depends on the influence of regulatory proteins.

Promoter structure determines the basal level of transcription
initiation
The consensus sequence for the E. coli promoter (Section 11.2.2) is quite
variable, with a range of different motifs being permissible at both the –35
and –10 boxes (see Table 11.4). These variations, together with less-welldefined sequence features around the transcription start site and in the first
50 or so nucleotides of the transcription unit, affect the efficiency of the promoter. Efficiency is defined as the number of productive initiations that are
promoted per second, a productive initiation being one that results in the
RNA polymerase clearing the promoter and beginning synthesis of a fulllength transcript. The exact way in which the sequence of the promoter
affects initiation is not known, but from our discussion of the events involved
in transcription initiation (Section 11.2.3) we might, intuitively, expect that

Genomes Chapter 11

27/3/06

12:28 pm

Page 317

Regulation of Transcription Initiation

the precise sequence of the –35 box would influence recognition by the s
subunit and hence the rate of attachment of RNA polymerase, that the transition from the closed to open promoter complex might be dependent on the
sequence of the –10 box, and that the frequency of abortive initiations (ones
that terminate before they progress very far into the transcription unit) might
be influenced by the sequence at, and immediately downstream of,
nucleotide +1. All this is speculation but it is a sound “working hypothesis.”
What is clear is that different promoters vary 1000-fold in their efficiencies,
the most efficient promoters (called strong promoters) directing 1000 times
as many productive initiations as the weakest promoters. We refer to these as
differences in the basal rate of transcription initiation.
Note that the basal rate of transcription initiation for a gene is preprogrammed by the sequence of its promoter and so, under normal circumstances, cannot be changed. It could be changed by a mutation that alters a
critical nucleotide in the promoter, and undoubtedly this happens from time
to time, but it is not something that the bacterium has control over. The bacterium can, however, determine which promoter sequences are favored by
changing the s subunit of its RNA polymerase. The s subunit is the part of the
polymerase that has the sequence-specific DNA-binding capability (Section
11.2.3), so replacing one version of this subunit with a different version with
a slightly different DNA-binding motif, and hence an altered sequence specificity, would result in a different set of promoters being recognized. In E. coli,
the standard s subunit, which recognizes the consensus promoter sequence
and hence directs transcription of most genes, is called s70 (its molecular
mass is approximately 70 kDa). E. coli also has a second s subunit, s32, which
is made when the bacterium is exposed to a heat shock. During a heat shock,
E. coli, in common with other organisms, switches on a set of genes coding for
special proteins that help the bacterium withstand the stress (Figure 11.23).
These genes have special promoter sequences, ones specifically recognized
by the s32 subunit. The bacterium is therefore able to switch on a whole range
of different genes by making one simple alteration to the structure of its RNA
polymerase. This system is common in bacteria: for example, Klebsiella pneumoniae uses it to control expression of genes involved in nitrogen fixation,
this time with the s54 subunit, and Bacillus species use a whole range of different s subunits to switch on and off groups of genes during the changeover
from normal growth to formation of spores (Section 14.3.2).

Regulatory control over bacterial transcription initiation
Promoter structure determines the basal rate of transcription initiation for a
bacterial gene but, with the exception of recognition by alternative s subunits, does not provide any general means by which the expression of the
gene can respond to changes in the environment or to the biochemical
requirements of the cell. Other types of regulatory control are needed.
The foundation of our understanding of regulatory control over transcription
initiation in bacteria was laid in the early 1960s by François Jacob, Jacques
Monod, and other geneticists who studied the lactose operon and other
model systems. We have already seen how this work led to discovery of the
promoter for the lactose operon (Section 11.2.2). It also resulted in identification of the operator, a region adjacent to the promoter and which regulates
initiation of transcription of the operon (Figure 11.24A). The original model
envisaged that a DNA-binding protein—the lactose repressor—attached to

Figure 11.24 Regulation of the lactose operon of Escherichia coli. (A) The operator sequence lies immediately downstream of the
promoter for the lactose operon. Note that this sequence has inverted symmetry: when read in the 5¢Æ3¢ direction, the sequence is the same
in both strands. This enables two subunits of the tetrameric repressor protein to make contact with a single operator sequence. (B) In the
original model for lactose regulation, the lactose repressor is looked on as a simple blocking device that binds to the operator and prevents the
RNA polymerase gaining access to the promoter. The three genes in the operon are therefore switched off. This is the situation in the absence
of lactose, although transcription is not completely blocked because the repressor occasionally detaches, allowing a few transcripts to be made.
Because of this basal level of transcription, the bacterium always possesses a few copies of each of the three enzymes coded by the operon
(see Figure 8.8A), probably less than five of each. This means that when the bacterium encounters a source of lactose it is able to transport a
few molecules into the cell and split these into glucose and galactose. An intermediate in this reaction is allolactose, an isomer of lactose,
which induces expression of the lactose operon by binding to the repressor, causing a change in the conformation of the latter so it is no
longer able to attach to the operator. This allows the RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and transcribe the three genes. When fully
induced, approximately 5000 copies of each protein product are present in the cell. When the lactose supply is used up and allolactose is no
longer present, the repressor reattaches to the operator and the operon is switched off. The transcripts of the operon, which have a half-life of
less than 3 minutes, decay and the enzymes are no longer made. Note that the shapes of the repressor and polymerase structures shown
here are purely schematic.

the operator and prevented the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, simply by denying it access to the relevant segment of DNA (Figure
11.24B). Whether the repressor binds depends on the presence in the cell of
allolactose, an isomer of lactose, the latter being the substrate for the biochemical pathway carried out by the enzymes coded by the three genes in the
operon. Allolactose is an inducer of the lactose operon. When allolactose is
present it binds to the lactose repressor, causing a slight structural change
which prevents the HTH motifs of the repressor from recognizing the operator as a DNA binding site. The allolactose–repressor complex therefore cannot bind to the operator, enabling the RNA polymerase to gain access to the
promoter. When the supply of lactose is used up and there is no allolactose
left to bind to the repressor, the repressor reattaches to the operator and prevents transcription. The operon is therefore expressed only when the
enzymes coded by the operon are needed.
Most of the original scheme for regulation of the lactose operon has been confirmed by DNA sequencing of the control region and by structural studies of

the repressor bound to its operator. The one complication has been the discovery that the repressor has three potential binding sites, centered on
nucleotide positions –82, +11, and +412. The operator defined by genetic studies is the sequence located at +11 (see Figure 11.24A), and this is the only one
of the three sites whose occupancy by the repressor would be expected to prevent access of the RNA polymerase to the promoter. But the other two sites
also play some role in repression as their removal, individually or together, significantly impairs the ability of the repressor to switch off gene expression.
The repressor is a tetramer of four identical subunits that work in pairs to
attach to a single operator, so the repressor has the capacity to bind to two of
the three operator sites at once. One possibility is that binding of one pair of
subunits to the +11 site is enhanced or stabilized by attachment of the other
pair of subunits to the –82 or +412 site. It is also possible that the repressor can
bind to a pair of operator sequences in such a way that it does not block
attachment of the polymerase to the promoter, but does prevent a later step in
initiation, such as formation of the open promoter complex.
The basic principle underlying the regulatory control of transcription initiation, as illustrated by the lactose operon, is that attachment of a DNA-binding protein to its specific recognition site can influence the events involved in
assembly of the transcription initiation complex and/or initiation of productive RNA synthesis by an RNA polymerase. Several variations on this theme
are seen with other bacterial genes:
G

Some repressors respond not to an inducer but to a co-repressor. An
example is provided by the tryptophan operon of E. coli, which codes for
a set of genes involved in synthesis of tryptophan (see Figure 8.8B). In contrast to the lactose operon, the regulatory molecule for the tryptophan
operon is not a substrate for the relevant biochemical pathway, but the
product, tryptophan itself (Figure 11.25). Only when tryptophan is
attached to the tryptophan repressor can the latter bind to the operator.
The tryptophan operon is therefore switched off in the presence of tryptophan, and switched on when tryptophan is needed.

G

Some DNA-binding proteins are activators rather than repressors of transcription initiation. The best-studied example in E. coli is the catabolite
activator protein, which binds to sites upstream of several operons,
including the lactose operon, and increases the efficiency of transcription
initiation, probably by forming a direct contact with the RNA polymerase.
The biological role of the catabolite activator protein is described in
Section 14.1.1.

Tryptophan

Figure 11.25 Regulation of the
tryptophan operon of Escherichia coli.
Regulation occurs via a repressor–operator
system in a similar way to that described for
the lactose operon, but with the difference
that the operon is repressed by the
regulatory molecule, tryptophan, which is
the product of the biochemical pathway
specified by the genes in the operon (see
Figure 8.8B). When tryptophan is present,
and so does not need to be synthesized,
the operon is switched off because the
repressor–tryptophan complex binds to the
operator. In the absence of tryptophan, the
repressor cannot attach to the operator, and
the operon is expressed.

G

The same repressor or activator can control two or more promoters. For
example, in E. coli the tryptophan repressor controls the tryptophan
operon, the aroH gene (which specifies an enzyme for an early step in the
biochemical pathway leading to tryptophan), and the trpR gene (which is
the tryptophan repressor’s own gene, meaning that the repressor protein
is synthesized only when it is needed) (Figure 11.26).

G

Recognition sequences for DNA-binding proteins can work singly or
together to increase or repress transcription of genes to which they are not
closely linked. These enhancers and silencers are not common in bacteria but a few examples are known, including an enhancer that acts on the
E. coli heat-shock genes whose promoters are recognized by the s32 version of the RNA polymerase. Because they are so far from the genes that
they control, they can only form a contact with the RNA polymerase if the
DNA forms a loop. A characteristic feature is that a single enhancer or
silencer can control expression of more than one gene.

All of these basic principles of gene regulation apply not only to bacteria but,
as we will see in the next section, also to eukaryotes.

11.3.2 Control of transcription initiation in eukaryotes
The key lesson that we have learnt from our examination of transcriptional
control in bacteria is that transcription initiation can be influenced by DNAbinding proteins that recognize specific sequences located near the attachment site for the RNA polymerase. This is also the basis to transcriptional
control in eukaryotes, with two differences, the first of which concerns the
basal rate of transcription initiation. The bacterial RNA polymerase has a
strong affinity for its promoter and the basal rate of transcription initiation is
relatively high for all but the weakest promoters. With most eukaryotic genes,
the reverse is true. The RNA polymerase II and III preinitiation complexes do
not assemble efficiently and the basal rate of transcription initiation is therefore very low, regardless of how “strong” the promoter is. In order to achieve
effective initiation, formation of the complex must be activated by additional
proteins. This means that, compared with bacteria, eukaryotes use different
strategies to control transcription initiation, with activators playing a much
more prominent role than repressor proteins.
The second difference is that, as with all aspects of genome expression, the
processes that regulate transcription initiation in eukaryotes are substantially
more complex than those occurring in bacteria.

Regulation of Transcription Initiation

Eukaryotic promoters contain regulatory modules
This greater complexity is apparent when we examine eukaryotic promoters.
Transcription initiation for a typical protein-coding gene is influenced by a
variety of different biochemical signals which act together to ensure that the
gene is expressed at precisely the level that is appropriate for the prevailing
conditions within and external to the cell in which that gene is located. An
RNA polymerase II promoter can be looked on as a series of modules, each
comprising a short sequence of nucleotides and each acting as the binding
site for a protein that influences assembly of the transcription initiation complex. Many different genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II (over 30,000
in humans) but there are only a limited number of promoter modules for this
polymerase. The expression pattern for a gene is therefore determined not by
an individual module but by the combination of modules within its promoter, and possibly by their relative positions. The amount of transcription
initiation that occurs is dependent on which modules are occupied by their
binding proteins at a particular time.
The modules for an RNA polymerase II promoter can be categorized in various ways. One scheme is as follows:
G

The core promoter modules (Section 11.2.2), the most important of these
being the TATA box and the Inr sequence.

G

Basal promoter elements are modules that are present in many RNA
polymerase II promoters and set the basal level of transcription initiation,
without responding to any tissue-specific or developmental signals. These
include: the CAAT box (consensus 5¢–GGCCAATCT–3¢), recognized by the
activators NF-1 and NF-Y; the GC box (consensus 5¢–GGGCGG–3¢), recognized by the Sp1 activator; and the octamer module (consensus 5¢–ATGCAAAT–3¢), recognized by Oct-1.

G

Response modules are found upstream of various genes and enable transcription initiation to respond to general signals from outside of the cell.
Examples are: the cyclic AMP response module CRE (consensus
5¢–WCGTCA–3¢, where W is A or T), recognized by the CREB activator; the
heat-shock module (consensus 5¢–CTNGAATNTTCTAGA–3¢, where N is
any nucleotide), recognized by Hsp70 and other activators; and the serum
response module (consensus 5¢–CCWWWWWWGG–3¢), recognized by the
serum response factor.

G

Cell-specific modules are located in the promoters of genes that are
expressed in just one type of tissue. Examples include: the erythroid module (consensus 5¢–WGATAR–3¢, where R is A or G), which is the binding site
for the GATA-1 activator; the pituitary cell module (consensus
5¢–ATATTCAT–3¢), recognized by Pit-1; the myoblast module (consensus
5¢–CAACTGAC–3¢), recognized by MyoD; and the lymphoid cell module, or
kB site (consensus 5¢–GGGACTTTCC–3¢), recognized by NF-kB. Note that
in lymphoid cells, the octamer module is recognized by the tissue-specific
Oct-2 activator.

G

Modules for developmental regulators mediate expression of genes that
are active at specific developmental stages. Two examples in Drosophila are
the Bicoid module (consensus 5¢–TCCTAATCCC–3¢) and the Antennapedia
module (consensus 5¢–TAATAATAATAATAA–3¢) (Section 14.3.4).

The modular structure of a typical RNA polymerase II promoter is shown in
Figure 11.27. As well as the modules in the region immediately upstream of the

gene, the same and other modules can also be contained within enhancers,
which are 200–300 bp in length and can be located some distance upstream or
downstream of their target gene. Silencers are similar to enhancers but, as
their name suggests, their modules have a negative rather than enhancing
influence on transcription initiation.
An additional level of complexity is seen with some genes that have alternative promoters that give rise to different versions of the transcript specified
by the gene. An example is provided by the human dystrophin gene, which
has been extensively studied because defects in this gene result in the genetic
disease called Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The dystrophin gene is one of
the largest known in the human genome, stretching over 2.4 Mb and containing 78 introns. It has at least seven alternative promoters (Figure 11.28).
Three of these lie upstream of the gene and give rise to full-length transcripts
that differ only in the identity of the first exon; these three promoters are
active in cortical tissue, muscles, and the cerebellum, respectively. The other
four promoters are located within the gene and give shortened transcripts
that again are synthesized in a tissue-specific manner. Each promoter has its
own modular structure though each is influenced by the same enhancer and
silencer sequences. Alternative promoters are also used to generate related
versions of some proteins at different stages in development, and to enable a
single cell to synthesize similar proteins with slightly different biochemical
properties. The last point indicates that although usually referred to as “alternative” promoters these are, more correctly, “multiple” promoters as more
than one may be active at a single time. Indeed, this may be the normal situation for many genes. For example, a genome-wide survey has revealed that
10,500 promoters are active in human fibroblast cells, but that these promoters are driving expression of less than 8000 genes, indicating that a substantial number of genes in these cells are being expressed from two or more promoters simultaneously.

Regulation of Transcription Initiation

Enhancer

at the promoter to which these elements are attached, and other activators target sites within enhancers and influence transcription of several genes at once
(Figure 11.29). As with bacteria, eukaryotic enhancers can be some distance
from their genes, their target specificity being ensured by the presence of insulators at either side of each functional domain, preventing the enhancers
within that domain from influencing gene expression in adjacent domains
(Section 10.1.2). Whether bound to an upstream promoter element or to a
more distant enhancer, the activator stabilizes the preinitiation complex.
Coactivators are much more diverse. They include histone acetylation complexes such as SAGA (Section 10.2.1) and nucleosome remodeling complexes
such as Swi/Snf (Section 10.2.2). Other proteins classed as coactivators influence gene expression by introducing bends and other distortions into DNA,
possibly as a prelude to chromatin modification, or possibly to bring together
proteins attached to nonadjacent sites, enabling the bound factors to work
together in a structure that has been called an enhanceosome. An example of
a coactivator that works in this way is SRY, which is the primary protein
responsible for determining sex of mammals.
Activators have been looked upon as important in initiation by RNA polymerases II and III, but their role at RNA polymerase I promoters has been less
well defined. RNA polymerase I is unusual in that it transcribes just a single set
of genes: the multiple copies of the transcription unit containing the 28S, 5.8S,
and 18S rRNA sequences (Section 7.2.3). These genes are expressed continuously in most cells, but the rate of transcription varies during the cell cycle and
is subject to a certain amount of tissue-specific regulation. The regulatory
mechanism has not been described in detail but recent research has suggested
a role for the RNA polymerase I termination factor. This factor, called TTF-I in
mice and Reb1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, was first identified as an activator
of RNA polymerase II transcription. It appears that the termination factor may
also activate RNA polymerase I transcription, a binding site for it having been
located immediately upstream of the promoter for the rRNA transcription unit.

The mediator forms the contact between an activator and the RNA
polymerase II preinitiation complex
A critical feature of the “traditional” type of activator—those that bind to
upstream promoter elements or to enhancers—is the contact that is formed
with the preinitiation complex. The part of the activator involved in this contact is called the activation domain. Structural studies have shown that
although activation domains are variable, most of them fall into one of three
categories:
G

Acidic domains are ones that are relatively rich in acidic amino acids
(aspartic acid and glutamic acid). This is the commonest category of activation domain.

G

Glutamine-rich domains are often found in activators whose DNA-binding motifs are of the homeodomain or POU type (Section 11.1.1).

G

Proline-rich domains are less common.

Details of the interaction between activators and the RNA polymerase II
preinitiation complex were obscure for several years, with apparently conflicting evidence coming from work with different organisms. A number of
protein–protein interaction studies had suggested that direct contacts could
be made between different activators and various parts of the complex, with
TBP, various TAFs, TFIIB, TFIIH, and RNA polymerase II all implicated as partners in different interactions. The solution to this conundrum was suggested
when a large protein complex called the mediator was identified in yeast. The
yeast mediator comprises 21 subunits that form a structure with distinct
head, middle, and tail domains. The tail forms a physical contact with an activator protein attached to its DNA recognition sequence, and the middle and
head sections interact with the preinitiation complex (Figure 11.30).
Therefore, rather than the activator associating directly with the preinitiation
complex, the association is indirect with the activation signal transduced by
the mediator. Initially it was thought that the mediator activated transcription initiation by directly phosphorylating the CTD of RNA polymerase II,
stimulating promoter clearance (Section 11.2.3), but it is now known that this
kinase activity is provided by Kin28, a subunit of TFIIH. There is evidence that
the mediator is able to stimulate Kin28 activity, but this is not its only interaction with the preinitiation complex, and the precise way in which it regulates transcription initiation is not yet clear. The mediator is present when
TBP attaches to the TATA box, and could form part of the platform onto which
the remainder of the preinitiation complex is constructed. A complicating
factor is that the mediator transduces signals not only from activators but
also from repressors, which means that its influence on the preinitiation
complex has to be both positive and negative.
Mediators in higher eukaryotes are larger than the yeast complex, with 30 or
more proteins making up the human version. One feature of the mammalian
mediator is that its protein composition is variable, raising the possibility that
there are several versions, each one responding to a different, although possibly overlapping, set of activators. Current opinion tends to the view that a
mediator is an obligatory component of the RNA polymerase II preinitiation
complex, and that the stimulatory effects of all activators pass through the
mediator. The possibility that some activators bypass the mediator and have
a direct effect on one or other part of the preinitiation complex cannot, however, be discounted.

Repressors of eukaryotic transcription initiation
Most of the research on regulation of transcription initiation in eukaryotes
has concentrated on activation, partly because the low level of basal initiation
occurring at RNA polymerase II and III promoters suggests that the repression of initiation, which is so important in bacteria (Section 11.3.1), is
unlikely to play a major part in control of eukaryotic transcription. This view
is probably incorrect because a growing number of DNA-binding proteins
that repress transcription initiation are being discovered, these proteins
binding to upstream promoter elements or to more distant sites in silencers.
Some influence genome expression in a general way through histone
deacetylation (Section 10.2.1) or DNA methylation (Section 10.3.1), but others have more specific effects at individual promoters. The yeast repressors
called Mot1 and NC2, for example, inhibit assembly of the preinitiation complex by binding directly to TBP and disrupting its activity. Mot1 causes TBP to
dissociate from the DNA, and NC2 prevents further assembly of the complex

on the bound TBP. Both of these repressors have a broad spectrum of activity,
inactivating a large set of genes, as does the Ssn6-Tup1 repressor, which is one
of the main gene silencers in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and
which has homologs in many other eukaryotes.
Another indication of the importance of repression in eukaryotic transcription comes from the demonstration that some proteins can exert both activating and repressing effects, depending on the circumstances. NC2, for
example, represses initiation of transcription from promoters with a TATA box
but has an activating effect on promoters that lack the TATA sequence. Pit-1,
which is the first of the three proteins after which the POU domain is named
(Section 11.1.1), activates some genes and represses others, depending on the
sequence of the DNA binding site. The presence in this site of two additional
nucleotides induces a change in the conformation of Pit-1, enabling it to
interact with a second protein called N-CoR and repress transcription of the
target gene (Figure 11.31).

Controlling the activities of activators and repressors
The operation of individual activators and repressors must be controlled in
order to ensure that the appropriate set of genes is expressed by a cell. We will
return to this topic in Chapter 14, when it will form the central theme of our
study of the ways in which genome activity is regulated in response to extracellular signals and during differentiation and development.
There are several ways in which an activator or repressor could be regulated.
One possibility is to control its synthesis, but this does not permit rapid
changes in genome expression because it takes time to accumulate an activator or repressor in the cell, or to destroy it when it is not needed. This type of
control is therefore associated with activators and repressors responsible for
maintaining stable patterns of genome expression, for example those underlying cellular differentiation and some aspects of development. An alternative way of controlling an activator or repressor is by chemical modification,

Pit-1 is a dimer, and each monomer has
two POU domains. The two domains of one
monomer are shown in red and the two
domains of the other monomer are shown
in blue. The barrels are a-helices, with a3
being the recognition helix of each domain.
Note the difference between the
conformations of the domains when bound
to the two binding sites. The more open
structure adopted at the growth hormone
site enables the Pit-1 dimer to interact with
N-CoR and other proteins to repress
transcription of the growth hormone gene.
Pit-1 therefore activates the prolactin gene
but represses the growth hormone gene.

for example by phosphorylation, or by inducing a change in its conformation.
These changes are much more rapid than de novo synthesis, and enable the
cell to respond to extracellular signaling compounds that induce transient
changes in genome expression. We will examine the details of these various
regulatory mechanisms in Chapter 14.

Summary
The central players in transcription, and other aspects of genome activity, are
DNA-binding proteins that attach to the genome in order to perform their
biochemical functions. Many of these proteins are able to attach to specific
DNA sequences by virtue of DNA-binding motifs such as the helix–turn–helix
structure or the zinc finger. Their binding positions on DNA molecules can
be identified by gel retardation analysis and delineated in greater detail by
modification protection and modification interference assays. Some proteins recognize their binding sites by direct readout of the DNA sequence,
which is possible by making contacts within the major groove of the double
helix, as here the identity of nucleotides can be determined from the positions of the chemical groups attached to the purine and pyrimidine
nucleotides. Direct readout can be influenced by various indirect effects that
the nucleotide sequence has on the conformation of the helix, including the
formation of bends in adenine-rich sequences. Many DNA-binding proteins
act as dimers, contacting the helix at two positions simultaneously. Special
structures on the protein surface, such as leucine zippers, aid dimerization.
Bacteria have a single RNA polymerase that transcribes all the genes in the
genome, but eukaryotes have three different nuclear RNA polymerases, and
a different enzyme that works in mitochondria. Promoter sequences mark
the positions at which the transcription initiation complex must be assembled. The bacterial promoter comprises two sequence segments but eukaryotic promoters are much more complex, having a modular structure that
includes sequences that are recognized by the initiation complex and others
that act as binding sites for regulatory proteins. The bacterial RNA polymerase attaches directly to its promoter, but the initiation complexes for
each type of eukaryotic RNA polymerase contain ancillary proteins and must
be built up in an ordered fashion. Successful initiation results in a polymerase complex that is competent to achieve promoter clearance and begin
the transcription process. Transcription initiation is a key step at which
genome expression is regulated. Some bacteria are able to alter the structure
of their RNA polymerase so the enzyme recognizes a different set of promoters and hence transcribes a different set of genes. Expression of individual
genes in bacteria can also be controlled by repressor and activator proteins.
The same is true with eukaryotes, though activator proteins appear to be
more important than repressors. The regulatory proteins attach to sites adjacent to or some distance away from the promoters they control. In eukaryotes, activation of the transcription initiation complex occurs via the mediator, a multisubunit protein which forms a physical bridge between an activator and the RNA polymerase.

When you have read Chapter 12, you should be able to:
Give details of the elongation and termination phases of transcription in Escherichia coli, and
explain how these are regulated by antitermination, attenuation, and transcript cleavage proteins.
Describe the cutting events and chemical modifications involved in processing of functional RNA
in bacteria.
Summarize our current knowledge of RNA degradation in bacteria.
Give details of elongation and termination of eukaryotic transcripts, including the processes
responsible for capping and polyadenylation of eukaryotic mRNAs.
Distinguish between the splicing pathways of different types of intron, and in particular give a
detailed description of splicing of GU–AG introns, including examples of alternative splicing and
trans-splicing.
Describe the synthesis and processing of functional RNA in eukaryotes.
Define the term “ribozyme,” and give examples of ribozymes.
Explain how eukaryotic rRNAs are chemically modified at specific nucleotide positions.
Give examples of RNA editing in mammals and outline the more complex types of RNA editing
that occur in various other eukaryotes.
Describe the RNA degradation mechanisms of eukaryotes with emphasis on the roles of siRNAs
and miRNAs in RNA silencing.
Outline the events involved in transport of eukaryotic RNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.

Initiation of transcription, culminating with the RNA polymerase leaving the
promoter and beginning synthesis of an RNA molecule, is simply the first step
in the genome expression pathway. In this chapter and the next, we will follow the process onward and examine how transcription and translation eventually result in synthesis of the proteome. We begin by looking at the synthesis and processing of RNAs, including the mRNAs that make up the transcriptome and which specify the protein content of the cell, and the functional

RNAs that play essential roles in genome expression and other aspects of cell
biology (Section 1.2.2). The underlying events are similar in prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, but there are substantial differences in some of the details and, as
with other aspects of genome expression, there is a greater complexity to the
processes occurring in eukaryotes. We will therefore begin by examining RNA
synthesis and processing in bacteria.

12.1 Synthesis and Processing of Bacterial RNAs
Because there is just one bacterial RNA polymerase (Section 11.2.1), the general mechanism of RNA synthesis is the same for all bacterial genes. Distinctions do, however, arise when we consider the mechanisms by which synthesis of transcripts from individual genes is regulated.

The RNA polymerase has to keep a tight grip on both the DNA template and
the RNA that it is making in order to prevent the transcription complex from
falling apart before the end of the gene is reached. However, this grip must
not be so tight as to prevent the polymerase from moving along the DNA. To
understand how these apparently contradictory requirements are met, the
interactions between the polymerase, the DNA template, and the RNA transcript have been examined by X-ray crystallography studies (see Technical

transcription initiation has usually left the complex at this stage (Section
11.2.3). The RNA polymerase covers about 30 bp of the template DNA, including the transcription bubble of 12–14 bp, within which the growing transcript is held to the template strand of the DNA by approximately eight
RNA–DNA base pairs (Figure 12.2).

Note 11.1), combined with cross-linking experiments in which covalent
bonds are formed between the DNA or RNA and the polymerase, these bonds
enabling the amino acids that are closest to the DNA and RNA to be identified. The cross-linking experiments make use of a variety of photoreactive
compounds that can be attached to synthetic DNA and RNA molecules. After
assembly of the complex, the labels are activated by a pulse of light so that
they form cross-links between the nucleic acid and any amino acids within
the polymerase that are located close to the position of the label. Some labels
form cross-links with any amino acid and others are more discriminatory,
forming links only with lysines, for example. After cross-linking, the RNA
polymerase is disassembled into subunits and each subunit treated with
cyanogen bromide, which cuts polypeptides specifically at methionine
residues, yielding a characteristic set of fragments. Fragments that are crosslinked to the nucleic acid are then identified. These fragments must contain
the amino acids that were adjacent to the label in the intact transcription
elongation complex. By identifying as many cross-links as possible, a detailed
map can be built up (Figure 12.3). This information can then be combined
with the structural data from X-ray crystallography to construct a model of
the transcription elongation complex, showing the precise positioning of the
different parts of the DNA double helix and of the RNA transcript within the
polymerase (Figure 12.4). These experiments have shown that the double
helix lies between the b and b¢ subunits, within a trough on the enclosed surface of b¢. The active site for RNA synthesis also lies between these two subunits, with the non-template strand of DNA looping away from the active site
and held within the b subunit. The RNA transcript extrudes from the complex
via a channel formed partly by the b and partly by the b¢ subunit (at the bottom right of the structures in Figure 12.4).
The polymerase does not synthesize its transcript at a constant rate. Instead,
synthesis is discontinuous, with periods of rapid elongation interspersed by
brief pauses during which the active site of the polymerase undergoes a slight
structural rearrangement. A pause rarely lasts longer than 6 milliseconds, and
might be accompanied by the polymerase moving in reverse (backtracking)
along the template. Pauses occur randomly rather than being caused by any
particular feature of the template DNA. Pausing plays an important role in
transcript termination, as described below, but whether or not this is its only
function is currently unknown.

Termination of a bacterial transcript
Current thinking views transcription as a discontinuous process, with the
polymerase pausing regularly and making a “choice” between continuing
elongation by adding more ribonucleotides to the transcript, or terminating
by dissociating from the template. Which choice is selected depends on
which alternative is more favorable in thermodynamic terms. This model
emphasizes that, in order for termination to occur, the polymerase has to
reach a position on the template where dissociation is more favorable than
continued RNA synthesis.
Bacteria appear to use two distinct strategies for transcription termination.
About half the positions in Escherichia coli at which transcription terminates
correspond to DNA sequences where the template strand contains an
inverted palindrome followed by a run of deoxyadenosine nucleotides
(Figure 12.5). These intrinsic terminators are thought to utilize two
processes to promote dissociation of the polymerase and to destabilize the
attachment of the growing transcript to the template. First, when the
inverted palindrome is transcribed, the RNA sequence folds into a stable
hairpin, this RNA–RNA base pairing being favored over the DNA–RNA pairing that normally occurs within the transcription bubble. This reduces the
number of contacts made between the template and transcript, weakening
the overall interaction and favoring dissociation. Second, the interaction is
further weakened when the run of As in the template is transcribed, because
the resulting A–U base pairs have only two hydrogen bonds each, compared
with three for each G–C pair. The net result is that termination is favored over
continued elongation. This model is easy to rationalize with the known properties of DNA–RNA hybrids, but an alternative hypothesis has been
prompted by the result of cross-linking experiments, which have shown that
the RNA hairpin makes contact with a flap structure on the outer surface of
the RNA polymerase b subunit, adjacent to the exit point of the channel
through which the RNA emerges from the complex (Figure 12.6). Although
the flap structure is quite distant (some 6.5 nm) from the active site of the
polymerase, a direct connection is made between the two by a segment of bsheet within the b subunit. Movement of the flap could therefore affect the
positioning of amino acids within the active site, possibly leading to breakage of the DNA–RNA base pairs and termination of transcription. Additional
evidence in support of this model comes from the demonstration that the

surface of the RNA polymerase could
mediate termination. The hairpin that

the RNA emerges from the complex. The

the region of the b polypeptide that forms
the flap is connected directly to the active
site, indicated by the magnesium ion in
magenta and the nucleoside 5¢-triphosphate

the RNA hairpin and the flap could
therefore affect the positioning of amino
acids within the active site, possibly causing
the DNA–RNA base pairs to break, leading
to termination of transcription. Reprinted

The second type of bacterial transcription termination signal is Rho dependent. These signals usually retain the hairpin feature of intrinsic terminators,
although the hairpin is less stable and there is no run of As in the template.
Termination requires the activity of a protein called Rho, which attaches to
the transcript and moves along the RNA toward the polymerase. If the polymerase continues to synthesize RNA then it keeps ahead of the pursuing
Rho, but at the termination signal the polymerase stalls (see Figure 12.7).
Exactly why has not been explained—presumably the hairpin loop that
forms in the RNA is responsible in some way—but the result is clear: Rho is
able to catch up. Rho is a helicase, which means that it actively breaks base
pairs, in this case between the template and transcript, resulting in termination of transcription.

12.1.2 Control over the choice between elongation and
termination
Figure 12.7 Rho-dependent termination.
Rho is a helicase that follows the RNA
polymerase along the transcript. When the
polymerase stalls at a hairpin, Rho catches
up and breaks the RNA–DNA base pairs,
releasing the transcript. Note that the
diagram is schematic and does not reflect
the relative sizes of Rho and the RNA
polymerase.

Can the choice that a paused polymerase makes between continuing elongation or terminating transcription by dissociating from the template be influenced in any way? The answer is yes, this being the primary means by which
the synthesis (as opposed to initiation) of bacterial transcripts is regulated.

Antitermination results in termination signals being ignored
The first of these regulatory processes is called antitermination. This occurs
when the RNA polymerase ignores a termination signal and continues elongating its transcript until a second signal is reached (Figure 12.8). It provides

a mechanism whereby one or more of the genes at the end of an operon can
be switched off or on by the polymerase recognizing or not recognizing a termination signal located upstream of those genes. Antitermination is controlled by an antiterminator protein, which attaches to the DNA near the
beginning of the operon and then transfers to the RNA polymerase as it
moves past en route to the first termination signal. The presence of the
antiterminator protein causes the enzyme to ignore the termination signal,
presumably by countering the destabilizing properties of an intrinsic terminator or by preventing stalling at a Rho-dependent terminator.
Although the mechanics of antitermination are unclear, the impact that it can
have on gene expression has been described in detail, especially during the
infection cycle of bacteriophage l. Immediately after entering an E. coli cell,
transcription of the l genome is initiated by the bacterial RNA polymerase
attaching to two promoters, PL and PR, and synthesizing two “immediateearly” mRNAs, these terminating at positions tL1 and tR1 (Figure 12.9A). The
mRNA transcribed from PR to tR1 codes for a protein called Cro, one of the
major regulatory proteins involved in the l infection cycle. The second mRNA
specifies the N protein, which is an antiterminator. The N protein attaches to
the l genome at sites nutL and nutR and transfers to the RNA polymerase as
it passes. Now the RNA polymerase ignores the tL1 and tR1 terminators and
continues transcription downstream of these points. The resulting mRNAs
encode the “delayed-early” proteins (Figure 12.9B). Antitermination controlled by the N protein therefore ensures that the immediate-early and
delayed-early proteins are synthesized at the appropriate times during the l
infection cycle. One of the delayed-early proteins, Q, is a second antiterminator that controls the switch to the late stage of the infection cycle.

Chapter 12 Synthesis and Processing of RNA

Attenuation results in premature termination
RNA polymerase

Ribosome

Bacterial mRNAs do not undergo any significant forms of processing: the primary transcript that is synthesized by the RNA polymerase is itself the mature
mRNA, and its translation usually begins before transcription is complete
(Figure 12.10). This coupling of transcription and translation is important in
that it allows a special type of control, called attenuation, to be applied to the
regulation of bacterial mRNA synthesis.

DNA

RNA

Protein

Figure 12.10 In bacteria, transcription
and translation are often coupled.

Attenuation operates primarily with operons that code for enzymes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, but a few other examples are also known.
The tryptophan operon of E. coli (Section 11.3.1) illustrates how it works. In
this operon, two hairpin loops can form in the region between the start of
the transcript and the beginning of trpE. The smaller of these loops acts as
a termination signal, but the larger hairpin loop, which is closer to the start
of the transcript, is more stable. The larger loop overlaps with the termination hairpin, so only one of the two hairpins can form at any one time.
Which loop forms depends on the relative positioning between the RNA
polymerase and a ribosome which attaches to the 5¢ end of the transcript as
soon as it is synthesized in order to translate the genes into protein (Figure
12.11). If the ribosome stalls so that it does not keep up with the polymerase,
then the larger hairpin forms and transcription continues. However, if the

ribosome keeps pace with the RNA polymerase then it disrupts the larger
hairpin by attaching to the RNA that forms part of the stem of this hairpin.
When this happens, the termination hairpin is able to form, and transcription stops. Ribosome stalling can occur because upstream of the termination signal is a short open reading frame (ORF) coding for a 14-amino-acid
peptide that includes two tryptophans. If the amount of free tryptophan is
limiting, then the ribosome stalls as it attempts to synthesize this peptide,
while the polymerase continues to make its transcript. Because this transcript contains copies of the genes coding for the biosynthesis of tryptophan, its continued elongation addresses the requirement that the cell has
for this amino acid. When the amount of tryptophan in the cell reaches a
satisfactory level, the attenuation system prevents further transcription of
the tryptophan operon, because now the ribosome does not stall while
making the short peptide, and instead keeps pace with the polymerase,
allowing the termination signal to form.
The E. coli tryptophan operon is controlled not only by attenuation but also
by a repressor (Section 11.3.1). Exactly how attenuation and repression work
together to regulate expression of the operon is not known, but it is thought
that repression provides the basic on–off switch and attenuation modulates
the precise level of gene expression that occurs. Other E. coli operons, such as
those for biosynthesis of histidine, leucine, and threonine, are controlled
solely by attenuation. Interestingly, in some bacteria, including Bacillus subtilis, the tryptophan operon is one of those that does not have a repressor system and so is regulated entirely by attenuation. In these bacteria, attenuation
is mediated not by the speed at which the ribosome tracks along the mRNA,
but by an RNA-binding protein called trp RNA-binding attenuation protein
(TRAP) which, in the presence of tryptophan, attaches to the mRNA in the
region equivalent to the short ORF of the E. coli transcript (Figure 12.12).
Attachment of TRAP leads to formation of the termination signal and cessation of transcription.

Transcript cleavage proteins can prevent stalling of a
backtracked polymerase
Backtracking occurs when a paused polymerase enzyme reverses a short distance along the DNA template strand (Section 12.1.1). This displaces the
newly synthesized RNA molecule, whose 3¢ end becomes detached from the
template. To prevent the polymerase becoming stalled at this point, the
detached portion of the RNA molecule must be snipped off (Figure 12.13). The
polymerase possesses the necessary RNA cleavage activity, but normally this
activity is disfavored and hence stalling is likely to occur. Stalling is prevented
by a pair of transcript cleavage factors, called GreA and GreB which, despite
their name, do not actually cut the RNA, instead stimulating the polymerase
to do this itself. The two proteins probably work by repositioning one of two
magnesium ions that are present within the active site of the polymerase.
The role of GreA and GreB in preventing polymerase arrest has only recently
become clear, and no link has yet been made between these factors and any
specific regulatory process. There are, however, intriguing aspects to their
mode of action which suggest that they might act as mediators for regulatory
signals of one kind or another. The major parts of the GreA and GreB proteins are two a-helices separated by a short turn containing one aspartic
acid and one glutamic acid. These two helices form a needle-like structure

that penetrates into the RNA polymerase via the secondary channel, which
leads from the surface of the enzyme to the active site within the protein
complex (Figure 12.14). The two acidic amino acids at the point of the needle
are thought to interact with the pair of magnesium ions within the active site,
promoting cleavage of the detached RNA segment. The structure of GreA and
GreB is remarkably similar to that of a third protein, called DksA, which mediates the stringent response in E. coli and other bacteria. This response is activated when a bacterium encounters poor growth conditions such as low levels of essential amino acids. To conserve resources, the bacterium reduces its
rate of transcription, in particular the synthesis of rRNA and tRNA, to about
5% of the normal level. Activation of the stringent response involves ppGpp
and pppGpp (Figure 12.15), two unusual nucleotides also called alarmones,
which are synthesized by the RelA protein in response to amino acid starvation. The alarmones work in conjunction with DksA to shut down transcription. How this happens is still speculative, but the similarity between the
structure of DksA and that of GreA and GreB suggests that DksA, like the transcript cleavage factors, inserts its needle-like structure into the secondary
channel of the polymerase and, by virtue of the pair of acidic amino acids at
its tip (in this case, two aspartic acids), influences polymerase activity by
interacting with the essential magnesium ions within the active site. A recent
model gives the alarmones a direct role in this process by envisaging that
ppGpp enters the channel at the tip of the DksA needle and participates in the
contact with the magnesium ions.
Exactly which step in transcription is inhibited during the stringent response
is not known, some evidence pointing toward events occurring during the
initiation process and other results suggesting that polymerase pausing is the
target. The important point, however, is that the role of DksA in this regulatory process indicates that GreA and GreB, which act in a manner almost
indistinguishable from DksA, may also be involved in other, as yet undiscovered, mechanisms for regulating bacterial RNA synthesis.

12.1.3 Processing of bacterial RNAs
In Section 1.2.3 we learnt that most RNA molecules are synthesized as precursors which must be processed before they can carry out their functions in the
cell. Bacterial mRNA is the one exception to this rule, the initial transcripts of
most bacterial protein-coding genes being functional mRNAs that can immediately be translated (see Figure 12.10). Bacterial tRNAs and rRNAs, on the
other hand, are first transcribed as pre-RNAs which become functional only
after a series of cutting events and chemical modifications.

Cutting events release mature rRNAs and tRNAs from
their precursor molecules
Bacteria synthesize three different rRNAs, called 5S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and 23S
rRNA, the names indicating the sizes of the molecules as measured by sedimentation analysis (see Technical Note 7.1). The three genes for these
rRNAs are linked into a single transcription unit (which is usually present in

three rRNAs. Cutting events are therefore needed to release the mature
rRNAs. These cuts are made by ribonucleases III, P, and F at positions specified by double-stranded regions formed by base pairing between different

parts of the pre-rRNA (Figure 12.16). The cut ends are subsequently trimmed
by the exonuclease activities of ribonucleases M16, M23, and M5 to give the
mature rRNAs.
Genes for tRNAs are distributed around bacterial genomes, some on their own
and some as tandem arrays in multi-tRNA transcription units. In some bacteria, tRNA genes also occur as infiltrators in the rRNA transcription units, as is
the case with E. coli, which has either one or two tRNA genes between the 16S
and 23S genes in each of its seven rRNA transcription units (see Figure 12.16).
All pre-tRNAs are processed in similar though not identical ways. The example
shown in Figure 12.17 refers to the precursor for the tRNATyr molecule of E.
coli. The tRNA sequence within the precursor molecule adopts its base-paired
cloverleaf structure (see Figure 13.2) and two additional hairpin structures
form, one on either side of the tRNA. Processing begins with the cut by ribonuclease E or F, forming a new 3¢ end just upstream of one of the hairpins.
Ribonuclease D, which is an exonuclease, trims seven nucleotides from this
new 3¢ end and then pauses while ribonuclease P makes a cut at the start of the
cloverleaf, forming the 5¢ end of the mature tRNA. Ribonuclease D then
removes two more nucleotides, creating the 3¢ end of the mature molecule. All

mature tRNAs must end with the trinucleotide 5¢–CCA–3¢. With tRNATyr the
terminal CCA is present in the pre-RNA and is not removed by ribonuclease D,
but with some other pre-tRNAs this sequence is absent, or is removed by the
processing ribonucleases. This occurs with most of those pre-tRNAs whose 3¢
ends are created by an endonuclease called ribonuclease Z, which makes a cut
adjacent to the first base pair in the tRNA cloverleaf (see Figure 12.17) and
hence removes the region that would contain the terminal CCA. When the
CCA is absent, it has to be added by one or more template-independent RNA
polymerases such as tRNA nucleotidyltransferase.
Of the various nucleases mentioned above, ribonuclease P is particularly
interesting because the various subunits of this enzyme include one that is
made of RNA rather than protein. RNA subunits are present in several
enzymes involved in RNA processing, including ribonuclease MRP, which
works with ribonuclease P in processing of eukaryotic pre-rRNAs (Section
12.2.4). These hybrid protein–RNA enzymes may be relics of the RNA world,
the early period of evolution when all biological reactions centered around
RNA (Section 18.1.1).

Chapter 12 Synthesis and Processing of RNA

Nucleotide modifications broaden the chemical properties of tRNAs
and rRNAs
The final type of processing that occurs with pre-RNAs is the chemical modification of nucleotides within the transcript. This occurs with both prerRNAs and pre-tRNAs. A broad spectrum of chemical changes has been identified with different pre-RNAs: over 50 different modifications are known in
total (Figure 12.18). Most of these are carried out directly on an existing
nucleotide within the transcript but two modified nucleotides, queosine and
wyosine, are put in place by cutting out an entire nucleotide and replacing it
with the modified version.
Many of these unusual nucleotides were first identified in tRNAs, within
which approximately one in ten nucleotides becomes altered. These modifications are thought to mediate the recognition of individual tRNAs by the
enzymes that attach amino acids to these molecules (Section 13.1.1), and to
increase the range of the interactions that can occur between tRNAs and
codons during translation, enabling a single tRNA to recognize more than
one codon (Section 13.1.2). We know relatively little about how tRNA modifications are carried out, beyond the fact that there are a number of enzymes
that catalyze these changes. It is presumed that these enzymes use specific
features of the base-paired structure of the tRNA to identify the appropriate
nucleotides to modify.
Ribosomal RNAs are modified in two ways: by addition of methyl groups to,
mainly, the 2¢–OH group on nucleotide sugars, and by conversion of uridine
to pseudouridine (see Figure 12.18). The same modification occurs at the
same position on all copies of an rRNA, and these modified positions are, to a
certain extent, the same in different species. Some similarities in modification
patterns are even seen when bacteria and eukaryotes are compared, although
bacterial rRNAs are less heavily modified than eukaryotic ones. Functions for
the modifications have not been identified, although most occur within those
parts of rRNAs thought to be most critical to the activity of these molecules in
ribosomes (Section 13.2.1). Modified nucleotides might, for example, be
involved in rRNA-catalyzed reactions such as synthesis of peptide bonds. In
eukaryotes a complex machinery exists for modifying rRNA molecules
(Section 12.2.5), but this machinery is absent from bacteria, whose rRNAs are
modified by enzymes that directly recognize the sequence and/or structures
of the regions of RNA that contain the nucleotides to be modified. Often two
or more nucleotides in the same region are modified at once. Bacterial rRNA
modification is therefore similar to the systems for modifying tRNAs in both
bacteria and eukaryotes.

12.1.4 Degradation of bacterial RNAs
So far this chapter has concentrated on synthesis of RNAs. Their degradation
is equally important, especially with regard to mRNAs whose presence or
absence in the cell determines which proteins will be synthesized.
Degradation of specific mRNAs could be a powerful way of regulating
genome expression.
The rate of degradation of an mRNA can be estimated by determining its halflife in the cell. The estimates show that there are considerable variations
between and within organisms. Bacterial mRNAs are generally turned over
very rapidly, their half-lives rarely being longer than a few minutes, a reflection

Genomes Chapter 12

27/3/06

12:33 pm

Page 347

Synthesis and Processing of Bacterial RNAs

of the rapid changes in protein synthesis patterns that can occur in an actively
growing bacterium with a generation time of 20 minutes or so. Eukaryotic
mRNAs are longer lived, with half-lives of, on average, 10–20 minutes for yeast
and several hours for mammals.

Bacterial mRNAs are degraded in the 3¢Æ5¢ direction
Studies of mutant bacteria whose mRNAs have extended half-lives have identified a range of ribonucleases and other RNA-degrading enzymes that are
thought to be involved in mRNA degradation. These include:
G

RNase E and RNase III, which are endonucleases that make internal cuts
in RNA molecules.

G

RNase II, which is an exonuclease that removes nucleotides in the 3¢Æ5¢
direction.

G

Polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), which also removes nucleotides
sequentially from the 3¢ end of an mRNA but, unlike true nucleases,
requires inorganic phosphate as a cosubstrate.

No enzyme capable of degrading RNA in the 5¢Æ3¢ direction has yet been isolated from bacteria. This absence leads to the assumption that the main
degradative process for bacterial mRNAs is removal of nucleotides from the 3¢
end. This is not possible under normal circumstances because most mRNAs
have a hairpin structure near the 3¢ end, the same hairpin that induced termination of transcription (see Figures 12.5 and 12.7). This structure blocks the
progress of RNase II and PNPase, preventing them from gaining access to the
coding part of the transcript (Figure 12.19). The model for mRNA degradation
therefore begins with removal of the 3¢ terminal region, including the hairpin,
by one of the endonucleases, exposing a new end from which RNase II and
PNPase can enter the coding region, destroying the functional activity of the
mRNA. Polyadenylation may also have a role. Although looked on primarily
as a feature of eukaryotic mRNAs (Section 12.2.1), it has been known since
1975 that many bacterial transcripts have poly(A) tails at some stage in their
existence, but that these tails are rapidly degraded. At present it is not clear
whether polyadenylation precedes degradation of an mRNA, or whether it
occurs at various intermediate stages after degradation has begun.
In the cell, RNase E and PNPase are located within a multiprotein complex
called the degradosome. Other components of the degradosome include an
RNA helicase, which is thought to aid degradation by unwinding the doublehelix structure of the stems of RNA stem-loops. Fragments of rRNA occasionally copurify with the degradosome, suggesting that the complex might be
involved in both rRNA and mRNA degradation. But the exact role of the
degradosome is still not clear and a few researchers are sceptical about its
actual existence, pointing out that proteins not obviously involved in mRNA
degradation, such as the glycolysis enzyme enolase, appear to be components of the degradosome, possibly indicating that the complex is an artifact
that is produced during extraction of proteins from bacterial cells. A more significant gap in our knowledge concerns the way in which degradation is
specifically targeted at individual mRNAs. We know that specific degradation
occurs because mRNA degradation has been implicated in the regulation of
several sets of bacterial genes, such as the pap operon of E. coli, which codes
for proteins involved in synthesis of the cell surface pili. Unfortunately, the
process by which such control is exerted remains a mystery.

Chapter 12 Synthesis and Processing of RNA

12.2 Synthesis and Processing of Eukaryotic RNA
At the most fundamental level, transcription is similar in bacteria and eukaryotes. The chemistry of RNA polymerization is identical in all types of organism, and the three eukaryotic nuclear RNA polymerases are all structurally
related to the E. coli RNA polymerase, their three largest subunits being equivalent to the a, b, and b¢ subunits of the bacterial enzyme. The contacts
between the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, the template DNA, and the RNA
transcript, as revealed by X-ray crystallography and cross-linking studies, are
similar to the interactions described for bacterial transcription (Section
12.1.1), and the basic principle that transcription is a step-by-step competition between elongation and termination also holds.

polymerase moves away from the promoter
region and becomes committed to making
a transcript. Note that the drawing is
schematic and is not intended to indicate
the shape or subunit composition of the
RNA polymerase II complex that synthesizes
the transcript.

Despite the underlying similarities, the overall processes for mRNA synthesis in bacteria and eukaryotes are quite different. The most striking dissimilarity is the extent to which eukaryotic mRNAs are processed during transcription. In bacteria, the transcripts of protein-coding genes are not
processed at all: the primary transcripts are mature mRNAs. In contrast, all
eukaryotic mRNAs have a cap added to the 5¢ end, most are also polyadenylated by addition of a series of adenosines to the 3¢ end, many contain
introns and so undergo splicing, and a few are subject to RNA editing. A
function has been assigned to capping, but the reason for polyadenylation
largely remains a mystery. With splicing and editing we can appreciate why
the events occur—the former removes introns that block translation of the
mRNA, the latter changes the coding properties of the mRNA—but we do not
understand why these mechanisms have evolved. Why do genes have introns
in the first place? Why edit an mRNA rather than encoding the desired
sequences in the DNA?
Eukaryotic mRNAs are processed while they are being synthesized. The cap is
added as soon as transcription has been initiated, splicing and editing begin
while the transcript is still being made, and polyadenylation is an inherent
part of the termination mechanism for RNA polymerase II. To deal with all of
these events together would be confusing, with too many different things
being described at once. We will therefore postpone study of RNA editing
until later in the chapter, which means it can be dealt with in tandem with
similar forms of chemical modification that occur during rRNA and tRNA
processing, and we will devote a separate section to splicing after we have
studied capping, elongation, and polyadenylation.

Capping of RNA polymerase II transcripts occurs immediately
after initiation
Although phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II is the final step in initiation of transcription of
mRNA-encoding genes in eukaryotes (Section 11.2.3), it is not immediately
followed by the onset of elongation. A somewhat gray area exists in our understanding of the events that distinguish promoter clearance, which refers to
the transition from the preinitiation complex to a complex that has begun to
synthesize RNA, and promoter escape, during which the polymerase moves
away from the promoter region and becomes committed to making a transcript (Figure 12.20). The opposing effects of negative and positive elongation
factors influence the ability of the polymerase to begin productive RNA synthesis, and if the negative factors predominate then transcription halts before

the polymerase has moved more than 30 nucleotides from the initiation
point. Promoter escape could therefore be an important control point, but
how regulation is applied at this stage is not yet known.
Successful promoter escape could be linked with capping, this processing
event being completed before the transcript reaches 30 nucleotides in
length. The first step in capping is addition of an extra guanosine to the
extreme 5¢ end of the RNA. Rather than occurring by normal RNA polymerization, capping involves a reaction between the 5¢ triphosphate of the terminal nucleotide and the triphosphate of a GTP nucleotide. The g-phosphate of
the terminal nucleotide (the outermost phosphate) is removed, as are the b
and g phosphates of the GTP, resulting in a 5¢–5¢ bond (Figure 12.21). The
reaction is carried out by the enzyme guanylyl transferase. The second step
of the capping reaction converts the new terminal guanosine into 7-methylguanosine by attachment of a methyl group to nitrogen number 7 of the
purine ring, this modification catalyzed by guanine methyltransferase. The
two capping enzymes make attachments with the CTD and it is possible that
they are intrinsic components of the RNA polymerase II complex during promoter clearance.

Chapter 12 Synthesis and Processing of RNA

The 7-methylguanosine structure is called a type 0 cap and is the commonest form in yeast. In higher eukaryotes, additional modifications occur (see
Figure 12.21):
G

A second methylation replaces the hydrogen of the 2¢–OH group of what
is now the second nucleotide in the transcript. This results in a type 1 cap.

G

If this second nucleotide is an adenosine, then the amino group attached
to carbon number 6 of the purine ring might also be methylated.

G

Another 2¢–OH methylation might occur at the third nucleotide position,
resulting in a type 2 cap.

All RNAs synthesized by RNA polymerase II are capped in one way or another.
This means that as well as mRNAs, the snRNAs that are transcribed by this
enzyme are also capped (see Table 11.3). The cap may be important for export
of mRNAs and snRNAs from the nucleus (Section 12.2.7), but its best-defined
role is in translation of mRNAs, which is covered in Section 13.2.2.

Elongation of eukaryotic mRNAs
As mentioned above, the fundamental aspects of transcript elongation are
the same in bacteria and eukaryotes. The one major distinction concerns the
length of transcript that must be synthesized. The longest bacterial genes are
only a few kilobases in length and can be transcribed in a matter of minutes
by the bacterial RNA polymerase, which has a polymerization rate of several
hundred nucleotides per minute. In contrast, RNA polymerase II can take
hours to transcribe a single gene, even though it can work at a rate of up to
2000 nucleotides per minute. This is because the presence of multiple introns
in many eukaryotic genes (Section 12.2.2) means that considerable lengths of
DNA must be copied. For example, the pre-mRNA for the human dystrophin
gene is 2400 kb in length and takes about 20 hours to synthesize.
The extreme length of eukaryotic genes places demands on the stability of the
transcription complex. RNA polymerase II on its own is not able to meet these
demands: when the purified enzyme is studied in vitro its polymerization
rate is less than 300 nucleotides per minute because the enzyme pauses frequently on the template and sometimes stops altogether. In the nucleus,
pausing and stopping are reduced because of the action of a series of elongation factors, proteins that associate with the polymerase after it has cleared
the promoter and left behind the transcription factors involved in initiation.
Thirteen elongation factors are currently known in mammalian cells, displaying a variety of functions (Table 12.1). Their importance is shown by the
effects of mutations that disrupt the activity of one or other of the factors.

Synthesis and Processing of Eukaryotic RNA

Inactivation of CSB, for example, results in Cockayne syndrome, a disease
characterized by developmental defects such as mental retardation, and disruption of ELL causes acute myeloid leukemia.
A second difference between bacterial and eukaryotic transcript elongation is
that RNA polymerase II, as well as the other eukaryotic nuclear polymerases,
has to negotiate the nucleosomes that are attached to the template DNA that
is being transcribed. At first glance it is difficult to imagine how the polymerase can elongate its transcript through a region of DNA wound around a
nucleosome (see Figure 7.2). The solution to this problem is probably provided by elongation factors that are able to modify the chromatin structure in
some way. In mammals, the elongation factor FACT has been shown to interact with histones H2A and H2B, possibly influencing nucleosome positioning, and less-well-defined interactions have been demonstrated for other factors. Yeast possesses a factor called elongator, which has been assigned a role
in chromatin modification because it contains a subunit that has histone
acetyltransferase activity, but so far a homolog of this complex has not been
identified in mammals. An intriguing question is whether the first polymerase to transcribe a particular gene is a “pioneer” with a special elongation
factor complement that opens up the chromatin structure, with subsequent
rounds of transcription being performed by standard polymerase complexes
that take advantage of the changes induced by the pioneer.

Termination of synthesis of most mRNAs is combined with
polyadenylation
Most eukaryotic mRNAs have a series of up to 250 adenosines at their 3¢ ends.
These As are not specified by the DNA and are added to the transcript by a
template-independent RNA polymerase called poly(A) polymerase. This
polymerase does not act at the extreme 3¢ end of the transcript, but at an
internal site which is cleaved to create a new 3¢ end to which the poly(A) tail
is added.
The basic features of polyadenylation have been understood for some time.
In mammals, polyadenylation is directed by a signal sequence in the mRNA,
almost invariably 5¢–AAUAAA–3¢. This sequence is located between 10 and 30
nucleotides upstream of the polyadenylation site, which is often immediately
after the dinucleotide 5¢–CA–3¢ and is followed 10–20 nucleotides later by a
GU-rich region. Both the poly(A) signal sequence and the GU-rich region are
binding sites for multisubunit protein complexes, which are, respectively, the
cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF) and the cleavage
stimulation factor (CstF). Poly(A) polymerase and at least two other protein
factors must associate with bound CPSF and CstF in order for polyadenylation to occur (Figure 12.22). These additional factors include polyadenylatebinding protein (PADP), which helps the polymerase to add the adenosines,
possibly influences the length of the poly(A) tail that is synthesized, and
appears to play a role in maintenance of the tail after synthesis. In yeast, the
signal sequences in the transcript are slightly different, but the protein complexes are similar to those in mammals and polyadenylation is thought to
occur by more or less the same mechanism.
Polyadenylation was once looked on as a “posttranscriptional” event but it is
now recognized that the process is an inherent part of the mechanism for termination of transcription by RNA polymerase II. CPSF is known to interact

with TFIID and is recruited into the polymerase complex during the transcription initiation stage. By riding along the template with RNA polymerase
II, CPSF is able to bind to the poly(A) signal sequence as soon as it is transcribed, initiating the polyadenylation reaction (Figure 12.23). Both CPSF
and CstF form contacts with the CTD of the polymerase. It has been suggested that the nature of these contacts changes when the poly(A) signal
sequence is located, and that this change alters the properties of the elongation complex so that termination becomes favored over continued RNA synthesis. As a result, transcription stops soon after the poly(A) signal sequence
has been transcribed.
Even though polyadenylation can be identified as an inherent part of the termination process, this does not explain why it is necessary to add a poly(A) tail
to the transcript. A role for the poly(A) tail has been sought for several years,
but no convincing evidence has been found for any of the various suggestions
that have been made. These suggestions include an influence on mRNA stability, which seems unlikely as some stable transcripts have very short poly(A)
tails, and a role in initiation of translation. The latter proposal is supported by
research showing that poly(A) polymerase activity is repressed during those
periods of the cell cycle when relatively little protein synthesis occurs.

polyadenylation and termination of

CPSF binds to the polyadenylation signal
sequence as soon as it is transcribed. This
changes the interaction between CPSF and
the CTD of RNA polymerase II so that
termination of transcription is now favored
over continued elongation. Note that this is
a schematic representation and ignores the
possibility that CstF may also be a
component of the elongation complex. This
representation also shows CPSF leaving the
complex in order to bind to the
polyadenylation signal, when in reality it may
maintain its attachment to RNA polymerase
II during the polyadenylation process.

The role that is eventually ascribed to polyadenylation must take account of
the fact that not all eukaryotic mRNAs have a poly(A) tail. The nonpolyadenylated mRNAs are a small group but they include several important members,
most notably the mRNAs that specify the histone proteins. The 3¢ termini of
these nonpolyadenylated mRNAs are, like the polyadenylated versions, created by cleavage of the primary transcript at a specific position, but the cleavage signals and the proteins involved in the process are quite different. There
appear to be two cleavage signals within the transcript, the first of these a
hairpin loop that forms downstream of the coding region (Figure 12.24A). The
hairpin loop always comprises 6 bp in the stem and 4 nucleotides in the loop,
this particular configuration being essential for successful cleavage, although
the exact sequence of nucleotides in the structure can vary. The second signal
is a 9-nucleotide sequence (consensus 5¢–CAAGAAAGA–3¢) positioned about
12 nucleotides downstream of the hairpin. This sequence base-pairs with a
part of the U7-snRNA (Figure 12.24B), one of the family of small nuclear RNAs
whose members are involved in various aspects of RNA processing, including
intron splicing, as we will see in the next section. The pairing is stabilized by
a hairpin loop–binding protein and the cut is made four or five nucleotides
downstream of the hairpin. Exactly how this cut is made is not known: no protein with the necessary activity has yet been identified.

Regulation of mRNA synthesis in eukaryotes
When we examined synthesis of bacterial mRNAs we encountered a number
of processes by which control could be exerted over genome expression by
regulating the elongation–termination stage of transcription (Section 12.1.2).
Equivalent regulatory mechanisms in eukaryotes have proved elusive and,
from our current standpoint, transcriptional control processes appear to operate almost exclusively at the initiation stage, as described in Section 11.3.2,
rather than during the elongation and termination phases of mRNA synthesis.
Three potential control mechanisms should, however, be mentioned. First,
the RNA polymerase II elongation factor called TFIIS, although structurally
distinct from the bacterial Gre proteins that we met in Section 12.1.2, acts in
a similar fashion, accessing the active site of RNA polymerase II by insertion

of a needle-like structure through a channel that runs from the surface of the
enzyme complex. In this manner, TFIIS, like GreA and GreB, is able to restart
a stalled RNA polymerase by stimulating cleavage of the detached 3¢ segment
of the RNA transcript. We decided in Section 12.1.2 that although no specific
regulatory process has yet been ascribed to the Gre proteins, such a role is
possible, and by extrapolation that conclusion also applies to TFIIS.
The second potential mechanism for regulation of elongation and/or termination of eukaryotic mRNA synthesis centers on the phosphorylation status of
the CTD of RNA polymerase II. Recall that during the transcription initiation
process, phosphorylation of serines within the repeat component of the CTD
activates the polymerase and stimulates promoter clearance (Section 11.2.3).
This implies that a phosphorylated CTD might be essential for efficient RNA
synthesis. The observation that the phosphorylation status of the CTD is not
constant throughout the transcription process therefore suggests that changes
to this status might play some role in regulating transcription. Several kinase
proteins have been identified which phosphorylate the CTD, and at least three
phosphatases are known which can carry out the reverse reaction, removing
phosphates from the structure. Hence the machinery exists for modifying the
phosphorylation status of the CTD during elongation and termination, but as
yet no link with the regulation of transcription has been uncovered.
Finally, there is growing evidence that control of mRNA polyadenylation
might be an important regulatory mechanism in eukaryotes. Many eukaryotic genes have more than one polyadenylation signal sequence, which
means that termination can occur at different positions, resulting in mRNAs
with identical coding properties but with distinctive 3¢ ends. The different
polyadenylation signals appear to be used in different tissues, suggesting that
alternative polyadenylation could be an important mechanism for establishing tissue-specific patterns of genome expression.

12.2.2 Removal of introns from nuclear pre-mRNA
The existence of introns was not suspected until 1977 when DNA sequencing
was first applied to eukaryotic genes and it was realized that many of these
contain “intervening sequences” that separate different segments of the coding DNA from one another (Figure 12.25). We now recognize seven distinct
types of intron in eukaryotes, and additional forms in the archaea (Table
12.2). Two of these types—the GU–AG and AU–AC introns—are found in
eukaryotic protein-coding genes and are dealt with in this section; the other
types will be covered later in the chapter.

Figure 12.25 Introns. The structure of the
human b-globin gene is shown. This gene
is 1423 bp in length and contains two
introns, one of 131 bp and one of 851 bp,
which together make up 69% of the length
of the gene.

Few rules can be established for the distribution of introns in protein-coding
genes, beyond the fact that introns are less common in lower eukaryotes: the
6000 genes in the yeast genome contain only 239 introns in total, whereas
many individual mammalian genes contain 50 or more introns. When the
same gene is compared in related species, we usually find that some of the
introns are in identical positions but that each species has one or more unique
introns. This implies that some introns remain in place for millions of years,
retaining their positions while species diversify, whereas others appear or disappear during this same period. These observations have implications for theories regarding genome evolution (Section 18.3.2). The important point, however, is that a eukaryotic pre-mRNA may contain many introns, perhaps over
100, taking up a considerable length of the transcript (Table 12.3), and that

these introns must be excised and the exons joined together in the correct
order before the transcript can function as a mature mRNA.

Conserved sequence motifs indicate the key sites in GU–AG introns
With the vast bulk of pre-mRNA introns, the first two nucleotides of the intron
sequence are 5¢–GU–3¢ and the last two are 5¢–AG–3¢. They are therefore called
“GU–AG” introns and all members of this class are spliced in the same way.
These conserved motifs were recognized soon after introns were discovered
and it was immediately assumed that they must be important in the splicing
process. As intron sequences started to accumulate in the databases, it was
realized that the GU–AG motifs are merely parts of longer consensus
sequences that span the 5¢ and 3¢ splice sites. These consensus sequences vary
in different types of eukaryote; in vertebrates they can be described as:
5¢ splice site 5¢–AGØGUAAGU–3¢
3¢ splice site 5¢–PyPyPyPyPyPyNCAGØ–3¢
In these designations, “Py” is one of the two pyrimidine nucleotides (U or C),
“N” is any nucleotide, and the arrow indicates the exon–intron boundary.
The 5¢ splice site is also known as the donor site and the 3¢ splice site as the
acceptor site.

Other conserved sequences are present in some but not all eukaryotes.
Introns in higher eukaryotes usually have a polypyrimidine tract, a pyrimidine-rich region located just upstream of the 3¢ end of the intron sequence
(Figure 12.26). This tract is less frequently seen in yeast introns, but these
have an invariant 5¢–UACUAAC–3¢ sequence, located between 18 and 140
nucleotides upstream of the 3¢ splice site, which is not present in higher
eukaryotes. The polypyrimidine tract and the 5¢–UACUAAC–3¢ sequence are
not functionally equivalent, as described in the next two sections.

Outline of the splicing pathway for GU–AG introns
The conserved sequence motifs indicate important regions of GU–AG introns,
regions that we would anticipate either acting as recognition sequences for
RNA-binding proteins involved in splicing, or playing some other central role
in the process. Early attempts to understand splicing were hindered by technical problems (in particular, difficulties in developing a cell-free splicing system with which the process could be probed in detail), but during the 1990s
there was an explosion of information. This work showed that the splicing
pathway can be divided into two steps (Figure 12.27):
G

Cleavage of the 5¢ splice site occurs by a transesterification reaction promoted by the hydroxyl group attached to the 2¢ carbon of an adenosine
nucleotide located within the intron sequence. In yeast, this adenosine is
the last one in the conserved 5¢–UACUAAC–3¢ sequence. The result of the
hydroxyl attack is cleavage of the phosphodiester bond at the 5¢ splice site,
accompanied by formation of a new 5¢–2¢ phosphodiester bond linking
the first nucleotide of the intron (the G of the 5¢–GU–3¢ motif) with the
internal adenosine. This means that the intron has now been looped back
on itself to create a lariat structure.

G

Cleavage of the 3¢ splice site and joining of the exons result from a second
transesterification reaction, this one promoted by the 3¢–OH group attached
to the end of the upstream exon. This group attacks the phosphodiester

of the 5¢ splice site is promoted by the
hydroxyl (OH) attached to the 2¢–carbon of
an adenosine nucleotide within the intron
sequence. This results in the lariat structure
and is followed by the 3¢–OH group of the
upstream exon inducing cleavage of the 3¢
splice site. This enables the two exons to be
ligated, with the released intron being
debranched and degraded.

bond at the 3¢ splice site, cleaving it and so releasing the intron as the lariat structure, which is subsequently converted back to a linear RNA and
degraded. At the same time, the 3¢ end of the upstream exon joins to the
newly formed 5¢ end of the downstream exon, completing the splicing
process.
In a chemical sense, intron splicing is not a great challenge for the cell. It is
simply a double transesterification reaction, no more complicated than many
other biochemical reactions that are dealt with by individual enzymes. But a
complex machinery has evolved to deal with it. The difficulty lies with the
topological problems. The first of these is the substantial distance that might
lie between splice sites, possibly a few tens of kilobases, representing 100 nm
or more if the mRNA is in the form of a linear chain. A means is therefore
needed of bringing the splice sites into proximity. The second topological
problem concerns selection of the correct splice site. All splice sites are similar, so if a pre-mRNA contains two or more introns then there is the possibility that the wrong splice sites could be joined, resulting in exon skipping—
the loss of an exon from the mature mRNA (Figure 12.28A). Equally unfortunate would be selection of a cryptic splice site, a site within an intron or exon
that has sequence similarity with the consensus motifs of real splice sites
(Figure 12.28B). Cryptic sites are present in most pre-mRNAs and must be
ignored by the splicing apparatus.

snRNAs and their associated proteins are the central components of
the splicing apparatus
The central components of the splicing apparatus for GU–AG introns are the
snRNAs called U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6. These are short molecules (between
106 nucleotides [U6] and 185 nucleotides [U2] in vertebrates) that associate
with proteins to form small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) (Figure
12.29). The snRNPs, together with other accessory proteins, attach to the
transcript and form a series of complexes, the last one of which is the spliceosome, the structure within which the actual splicing reactions occur. The
process operates as follows (Figure 12.30):

associated proteins during splicing. There
are several unanswered questions about the
series of events occurring during splicing
and it is unlikely that the scheme shown
here is entirely accurate. The key point is
that associations between the snRNPs are
thought to bring the three critical parts of
the intron—the two splice sites and the
branch point—into close proximity.

The commitment complex initiates a splicing activity. This complex comprises U1–snRNP, which binds to the 5¢ splice site, partly by RNA–RNA
base pairing, and the protein factors SF1, U2AF35, and U2AF65, which
make protein–RNA contacts with the branch site, the polypyrimidine tract,
and the 3¢ splice site, respectively.

G

The prespliceosome complex comprises the commitment complex plus
U2–snRNP, the latter attached to the branch site. At this stage, an association between U1–snRNP and U2–snRNP brings the 5¢ splice site into close
proximity with the branch point.

G

The spliceosome is formed when U4/U6–snRNP (a single snRNP containing two snRNAs) and U5–snRNP attach to the prespliceosome complex.
This results in additional interactions that bring the 3¢ splice site close to
the 5¢ site and the branch point. All three key positions in the intron are
now in proximity and the two transesterifications occur as a linked reaction, possibly catalyzed by U6–snRNP, completing the splicing process.

The series of events shown in Figure 12.30 provides no clues about how the
correct splice sites are selected so that exons are not lost during splicing, and
cryptic sites are ignored. This aspect of splicing is still poorly understood but
it has become clear that a set of splicing factors called SR proteins are important in splice-site selection. The SR proteins—so-called because their C-terminal domains contain a region rich in serine (abbreviation S) and arginine
(R)—were first implicated in splicing when it was discovered that they are
components of the spliceosome. They appear to have several functions,
including the establishment of a connection between bound U1–snRNP and
the bound U2AF proteins in the commitment complex. This is perhaps the
clue to their role in splice-site selection, formation of the commitment complex being the critical stage of the splicing process, as this is the event that
identifies which sites will be linked.

SR proteins also interact with exonic splicing enhancers (ESEs), which are
purine-rich sequences located in the exon regions of a transcript. We are still
at an early stage in our understanding of ESEs and their counterparts, the
exonic splicing silencers (ESSs), but their importance in controlling splicing
is clear from the discovery that several human diseases, including one type of
muscular dystrophy, are caused by mutations in ESE sequences. The location
of ESEs and ESSs indicates that assembly of the spliceosome is driven not
simply by contacts within the intron but also by interactions with adjacent
exons. In fact, it is possible that an individual commitment complex is not
assembled within an intron as shown in Figure 12.30, but initially bridges an
exon (Figure 12.31). This model is attractive not only because it provides a
means by which contact between an ESE or ESS and an SR protein could
influence splicing, but also because it takes account of the large disparity
between the lengths of exons and introns in vertebrate genes. In the human
genome, for example, the exons have an average length of 145 nucleotides
compared with 3365 nucleotides for introns. Initial assembly of a commitment complex across an exon might therefore be a less difficult task than
assembly across a much longer intron.
There is one final aspect of SR proteins that we should address. This is the
possibility that a subset of these SR proteins, called CASPs (CTD-associated
SR-like proteins) or SCAFs (SR-like CTD-associated factors), form a physical connection between the spliceosome and the CTD of the RNA polymerase
II transcription complex, and hence provide a link between transcript elongation and processing. As with some of the polyadenylation proteins (Section
12.2.1), it is probable that these splicing factors ride with the polymerase as it
synthesizes the transcript, and are deposited at their appropriate positions at
intron splice sites as soon as these are transcribed. Electron microscopy studies have shown that transcription and splicing occur together, and the discovery of splicing factors that have an affinity for RNA polymerase II provides a
biochemical basis for this observation.

Alternative splicing is common in many eukaryotes
When introns were first discovered it was imagined that each gene always
gives rise to the same mRNA: in other words, that there is a single splicing
pathway for each primary transcript (Figure 12.32A). This assumption was
found to be incorrect in the 1980s, when it was shown that the primary transcripts of some genes can follow two or more alternative splicing pathways,
enabling a single transcript to be processed into related but different mRNAs
and hence to direct synthesis of a range of proteins (Figure 12.32B). In some
organisms alternative splicing is uncommon, only three examples being
known in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but in higher eukaryotes it is much more
prevalent. This first became apparent when the draft Drosophila melanogaster
genome sequence was examined, and it was realized that fruit flies have fewer

Figure 12.31 An alternative model for
assembly of the commitment complex. In
this model, each individual commitment
complex (one shown in orange and one in
red) is built up across an exon, bringing the
complex into close association with an
exonic splicing enhancer or silencer and its
attached SR proteins. Once complexes have
been built up over adjacent exons, splicing
follows the pathway illustrated in Figure
12.30, the only difference being that the
resulting spliceosome is made up of
components of adjacent commitment
complexes, rather than being derived from
the single commitment complex shown in
Figure 12.30.

genes than the microscopic worm Caenorhabditis elegans (see Table 7.4),
despite the obviously greater physical complexity of Drosophila, which should
be reflected in a more diverse proteome. The most likely explanation for the
lack of congruence between the number of genes in the Drosophila genome
and the number of proteins in its proteome is that a substantial number of the
genes give rise to multiple proteins via alternative splicing. At about the same
time as these observations, the first human chromosome sequences were
obtained and it was recognized that rather than having 80,000–100,000 genes,
as suggested by the size of the human proteome, humans have only 35,000 or
so genes. It is now believed that at least 35% of the genes in the human genome
undergo alternative splicing: the principle “one gene, one protein,”—biological dogma since the 1940s—has been completely overthrown.
Alternative splicing is now looked on as a crucial innovation in the genome
expression pathway. Two examples will suffice to illustrate its importance.
The first of these concerns sex determination, a fundamental aspect of the
biology of any organism, and which in Drosophila is determined by an alternative splicing cascade. The first gene in this cascade is sxl, whose transcript
contains an optional exon which, when spliced to the one preceding it,
results in an inactive version of protein SXL. In females the splicing pathway
is such that this exon is skipped so that functional SXL is made (Figure 12.33).
SXL promotes selection of a cryptic splice site in a second transcript, tra, by
directing U2AF65 away from its normal 3¢ splice site to a second site further
downstream. The resulting female-specific TRA protein is again involved in
alternative splicing, this time by interacting with SR proteins to form a multi-

during expression of genes involved in
sex determination in Drosophila. (A) The
cascade begins with sex-specific alternative
splicing of the sxl pre-mRNA. In males, all
exons are present in the mRNA, but this
means that a truncated protein is produced
because exon 3 contains a termination
codon. In females, exon 3 is skipped,
leading to a full-length, functional SXL
protein. (B) In females, SXL blocks the 3¢
splice site in the first intron of the tra premRNA. U2AF65 is unable to locate this site
and instead directs splicing to a cryptic site
in exon 2. This results in an mRNA that
codes for a functional TRA protein. In males,
there is no SXL so the 3¢ splice site is not
blocked and a dysfunctional mRNA is
produced. (C) In males, exon 4 of the dsx
pre-mRNA is skipped. The resulting mRNA
codes for a male-specific DSX protein. In
females, TRA stabilizes the attachment of
SR proteins to an exonic splicing enhancer
located within exon 4, so this exon is not
skipped, resulting in the mRNA that codes
for the female-specific DSX protein. The two
versions of DSX are the primary
determinants of the male and female
physiologies. The female dsx mRNA ends
with exon 4 because the intron between
exons 4 and 5 has no 5¢ splice site,
meaning that exon 5 cannot be ligated to
the end of exon 4. Instead a
polyadenylation site at the end of exon 4 is
recognized in females. Note that the
diagram is schematic and that the introns
are not drawn to scale.

for a membrane protein that regulates the entry and exit of potassium ions
into and out of cells. The gene has 35 exons, eight of which are involved in
alternative splicing events (Figure 12.34). The alternative splicing pathways
involve different combinations of the eight optional exons, leading to over
500 distinct mRNAs, each specifying a membrane protein with slightly different functional properties. The human slo genes are active in the inner ear and
determine the auditory properties of the hair cells on the basilar membrane
of the cochlea. Different hair cells respond to different sound frequencies
between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz, their individual capabilities determined in part
by the properties of their Slo proteins. Alternative splicing of slo genes in
cochlear hair cells therefore determines the auditory range of humans.
At present we do not understand how alternative splicing is regulated and
cannot describe the process that determines which of several splicing pathways is followed by a particular transcript. The players are thought to be the
SR proteins in conjunction with ESEs and ESSs, but the way in which they
control splice-site selection is not known.

Trans-splicing links exons from different transcription units
In the examples of splicing that we have considered so far, the two exons that
are joined together are both located within the same transcript. In a few organisms, splicing also takes place between exons that are contained within different RNA molecules. This is called trans-splicing and it occurs in the chloroplasts of some plants, with some genes in C. elegans, and in trypanosomes, the
protozoan parasites of vertebrates that cause sleeping sickness in humans.
All of the examples of trans-splicing that have been studied so far are similar
in that they result in the same short leader segment becoming attached to the
5¢ ends of each member of a set of mRNAs (Figure 12.35). The transcript
which donates this leader segment is called the spliced leader RNA (SL RNA).
In C. elegans, this SL RNA is approximately 100 nucleotides in length and contains a 22-nucleotide sequence that is attached to the 5¢ ends of the target
mRNAs. The splicing reaction proceeds in a manner very similar to the standard scheme shown in Figure 12.27, although as the splicing partners are different molecules a forked structure is formed instead of the lariat. The only
complication is that the SL RNA is able to fold into a base-paired structure
similar to an snRNA and, according to some models of trans-splicing, the SL
RNA replaces U1–snRNP in the splicing process.
Trans-splicing in C. elegans has one other interesting aspect. Some of the
mRNAs that participate in trans-splicing contain two genes which are transcribed together, head to tail, from a single promoter. If one of these two-gene

mRNAs in C. elegans is not trans-spliced then only the upstream gene can be
translated because, as we will see in Chapter 13, the ribosome that translates
a eukaryotic mRNA attaches to the extreme 5¢ end of the molecule and usually dissociates from the transcript when it reaches a termination codon.
Hence, with an unspliced mRNA, the downstream gene is inaccessible to the
translation apparatus. With these mRNAs, trans-splicing is therefore the
process that activates translation of the downstream gene by creating a new
5¢ end to which a ribosome can bind (Figure 12.36).

few introns in eukaryotic pre-mRNAs that do not fall into the GU–AG category, having different consensus sequences at their splice sites. These are the
AU–AC introns which, to date, have been found in approximately 20 genes in
organisms as diverse as humans, plants, and Drosophila.
As well as the sequence motifs at their splice sites, AU–AC introns have a conserved (though not invariant) branch site sequence with the consensus
5¢–UCCUUAAC–3¢, the last adenosine in this motif being the one that participates in the first transesterification reaction. This points us toward the
remarkable feature of AU–AC introns: their splicing pathway is very similar to
that for GU–AG introns, but involves a different set of splicing factors. Only
the U5–snRNP is involved in the splicing mechanisms of both types of intron.
For AU–AC introns, the roles of U1–snRNP and U2–snRNP are taken by
U11/U12–snRNP, a previously discovered complex that had never been assigned a function, and an entirely new U4atac/U6atac–snRNP has subsequently
been isolated to complete the picture.
The splicing pathways for the “major” and “minor” types of intron are not
identical but many of the interactions between the transcript and the snRNPs
and other splicing proteins are remarkably similar. This means that AU–AC
introns, rather than simply being a curiosity, are proving useful in testing
models for interactions occurring during GU–AG intron splicing. The argument is that a predicted interaction between two components of the GU–AG
spliceosome can be checked by seeing if the same interaction is possible with
the equivalent AU–AC components. This has already been informative in
helping to define a base-paired structure formed between the U2- and U6snRNAs in the GU–AG spliceosome.

12.2.3 Synthesis of functional RNAs in eukaryotes
In general, we know less about transcript elongation and termination by RNA
polymerases I and III than we do about equivalent processes for RNA polymerase II. The interaction of the polymerase with the template and transcript
during elongation appears to be similar with all three enzymes, a reflection of
the structural relatedness of the three largest subunits in each RNA polymerase. One difference is the rate of transcription—RNA polymerase I, for
example, being much slower than RNA polymerase II, managing a polymerization rate of only 20 nucleotides per minute, compared with up to 2000 per
minute for mRNA synthesis. A second difference is that neither RNA polymerase I transcripts nor RNA polymerase III transcripts are capped. Various
proteins that might act as elongation factors for RNA polymerase I or III have
been isolated, including SGS1 and SRS2 of yeast, which code for two related

DNA helicases. Mutations in the genes for SGS1 and SRS2 cause a reduction
in RNA polymerase I transcription as well as DNA replication. SGS1 is interesting because it is a homolog of a pair of human proteins that are defective
in the growth disorders Bloom’s and Werner’s syndromes (Section 5.2.1) but
the exact involvement of SGS1 and SRS2, and other putative elongation factors, in transcription by RNA polymerases I and III is not known.
The major differences between the three RNA polymerases are seen when the
termination processes are compared. The polyadenylation system for RNA
polymerase II termination (Section 12.2.1) is unique to that enzyme and no
equivalent has been described for the other two RNA polymerases.
Termination of transcription by RNA polymerase I involves a DNA-binding
protein, called Reb1p in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and TTF-I in mice, which
attaches to the DNA at a recognition sequence located 12–20 bp downstream
of the point at which transcription terminates (Figure 12.37). Exactly how the
bound protein causes termination is not known, but a model in which the
polymerase becomes stalled because of the blocking effect of Reb1p/TTF-I
has been proposed. A second protein, PTRF (polymerase I and transcript
release factor), is thought to induce dissociation of the polymerase and the
transcript from the DNA template. Even less is known about RNA polymerase
III termination: a run of adenosines in the template is implicated but the
process does not involve a hairpin loop and so is not analogous to termination in bacteria.

12.2.4 Splicing of eukaryotic pre-rRNA and pre-tRNA
In eukaryotes there are four rRNAs. One of these, the 5S rRNA, is transcribed
by RNA polymerase III and does not undergo processing. The remaining
three (the 5.8S, 18S, and 28S rRNAs) are transcribed by RNA polymerase I
from a single unit, producing a pre-rRNA which, as with the bacterial prerRNAs, is processed by cutting and end-trimming. Several nucleases are
required, including the multifunctional ribonuclease MRP which, as well as
5.8S rRNA processing, is involved in replication of mitochondrial DNA and
control of the cell cycle. Genes for tRNAs occur singly and as multigene transcription units, and are processed in a manner very similar to that seen in
bacteria (see Figure 12.17). The main distinction between functional RNA
processing in bacteria and eukaryotes is that the primary transcripts for some
eukaryotic rRNAs and tRNAs contain introns. Neither type of intron is similar
to the GU–AG and AU–AC introns of pre-mRNA, and we must therefore spend
some time examining them.

Introns in eukaryotic pre-rRNAs are autocatalytic
Introns are quite uncommon in eukaryotic pre-rRNAs but a few are known in
microbial eukaryotes such as Tetrahymena. These introns are members of the
Group I family (see Table 12.2) and are also found in mitochondrial and
chloroplast genomes, where they occur in pre-mRNA as well as pre-rRNA. A
few isolated examples are known in bacteria, for instance in a tRNA gene of
the cyanobacterium Anabaena and in the thymidylate synthase gene of the E.
coli bacteriophage T4.
The splicing pathway for Group I introns is similar to that for pre-mRNA
introns in that two transesterifications are involved. The first is induced not
by a nucleotide within the intron but by a free nucleoside or nucleotide, any
one of guanosine or guanosine mono-, di-, or triphosphate (Figure 12.38).

The 3¢–OH of this cofactor attacks the phosphodiester bond at the 5¢ splice
site, cleaving it, with transfer of the G to the 5¢ end of the intron. The second
transesterification involves the 3¢–OH at the end of the exon, which attacks
the phosphodiester bond at the 3¢ splice site, causing cleavage, joining of the
two exons, and release of the intron. The released intron is linear, rather than
the lariat seen with pre-mRNA introns, but may undergo additional transesterifications, leading to circular products, as part of its degradation process.
The remarkable feature of the Group I intron splicing pathway is that it proceeds in the absence of proteins and hence is autocatalytic, the RNA itself
possessing enzymatic activity. This was the first example of an RNA enzyme,
or ribozyme, to be discovered, back in the early 1980s. Initially this caused
quite a stir but it is now realized that, although uncommon, there are several
examples of ribozymes (Table 12.4). The self-splicing activity of Group I
introns resides in the base-paired structure taken up by the RNA. This structure was first described in two-dimensional terms by comparing the
sequences of different Group I introns and working out a common basepaired arrangement that could be adopted by all versions. This resulted in a
model comprising nine major base-paired regions (Figure 12.39). More
recently, the three-dimensional structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography. The ribozyme consists of a catalytic core made up of two domains,
each one comprising two of the base-paired regions, with the splice sites
brought into proximity by interactions between two other parts of the secondary structure. Although this RNA structure is sufficient for splicing, it is
possible that with some introns the stability of the ribozyme is enhanced by
noncatalytic protein factors that bind to it. This has long been suspected with
the Group I introns in organelle genes, many of these containing an open
reading frame coding for a protein called a maturase that appears to play a
role in splicing.

Removal of introns from eukaryotic pre-tRNAs
Transfer RNA introns are relatively common in lower eukaryotes but less frequent in vertebrates—introns are present in only 6% of all human tRNA
genes. Introns in eukaryotic pre-tRNAs are 14–60 nucleotides in length and
are usually found at the same position in the transcript, within the anticodon

loop, one nucleotide downstream of the anticodon itself. The intron
sequence is variable, but includes a short region complementary to the anticodon and possibly one or two adjacent nucleotides. Base pairing between
the complementary sequences forms a short stem between two loops in the
unspliced pre-tRNA (Figure 12.40).
Unlike all other types of introns in eukaryotes, splicing of pre-tRNA introns
does not involve transesterifications. Instead, the two splice sites are cut by
an endonuclease. This enzyme contains four nonidentical subunits, one of
which uses the structure of the base-paired intron as a guide to identify the
correct positions at which the RNA should be cut. The upstream and downstream cuts are then made by two of the other enzyme subunits. Cleavage
leaves a cyclic phosphate structure attached to the 3¢ end of the upstream
exon, and a hydroxyl group at the 5¢ end of the downstream exon (Figure
12.40). The cyclic phosphate is converted to a 3¢–OH end by a phosphodiesterase, and the 5¢–OH terminus is converted to 5¢–P by a kinase. These two
ends are held in proximity by the natural base pairing adopted by the tRNA
sequence and are ligated by an RNA ligase. The phosphodiesterase, kinase,
and ligase activities are provided by a single protein.

Other types of intron
There are eight different types of intron (see Table 12.2). Four of these have
already been described in this chapter: the nuclear pre-mRNA introns of the
GU–AG and AU–AC classes, the self-splicing Group I introns, and the introns
in eukaryotic pre-tRNA genes. For completeness, the details of the four other
categories are as follows:
G

Group II introns are found in the organelle genomes of fungi and plants,
in both pre-mRNA and pre-rRNA, and a few are known in prokaryotes.
Group II introns take up a characteristic secondary structure and they are
able to self-splice in the test tube, but they are distinct from Group I
introns. The secondary structure is different, and the splicing mechanism
is more closely allied to that of pre-mRNA introns, the initial transesterification being promoted by the hydroxyl group of an internal adenosine
nucleotide and the intron being converted into a lariat structure. These
similarities have prompted suggestions that Group II and pre-mRNA
introns may have a common evolutionary origin (see Section 18.3.2).
Some Group II introns are mobile elements that transpose by a remarkable process called retrohoming, during which the excised intron, which
of course is a single-stranded RNA molecule, inserts directly into the
organelle genome prior to being copied into the DNA version.

G

Group III introns are also found in organelle genomes and they selfsplice via a mechanism very similar to that of Group II introns, but
Group III introns are smaller and have their own distinctive secondary
structure. The resemblance to Group II introns again suggests an evolutionary relationship.

G

Twintrons are composite structures made up of two or more Group II
and/or Group III introns. The simplest twintrons consist of one intron
embedded in another, but more complex ones contain multiple embedded introns. The individual introns that make up a twintron are usually
spliced in a defined sequence.

G

Archaeal introns are present in tRNA and rRNA genes. They are cleaved by
a ribonuclease similar to the one involved in eukaryotic pre-tRNA splicing.

nucleotides by the base-paired structure of the tRNA molecule, similar to the
way in which the endonucleases that splice tRNA introns use the base-paired
structure as a guide. With eukaryotic rRNAs, the situation is rather different.

(A) Methylation by yeast U24-snoRNA
Modified nucleotide

Small nucleolar RNAs act as guides for chemical modification of
eukaryotic rRNAs
It is not easy, simply by intuition, to imagine how specificity of rRNA modification can be ensured. Human pre-rRNA, for example, undergoes 106 methylations and 95 pseudouridinylations, each alteration at a specified position,
with no obvious sequence similarities that can be inferred as target motifs for
the modifying enzymes. Not surprisingly, progress in understanding rRNA
modification was slow to begin with. The breakthrough came when it was
shown that in eukaryotes the short RNAs called snoRNAs are involved in the
modification process. These molecules are 70–100 nucleotides in length and
are located in the nucleolus, the region within the nucleus where rRNA processing takes place. The initial discovery was that by base-pairing to the relevant region, snoRNAs pinpoint positions at which the pre-rRNA must be
methylated. The base pairing involves only a few nucleotides, not the entire
length of the snoRNA, but these nucleotides are always located immediately
upstream of a conserved sequence called the D box (Figure 12.41A). The base
pair involving the nucleotide that will be modified is five positions away from
the D box. The hypothesis is that the D box is the recognition signal for the
methylating enzyme, which is therefore directed toward the appropriate
nucleotide. After these initial discoveries with regard to methylation, it was
shown that a different family of snoRNAs carries out the same guiding role in
conversion of uridines to pseudouridines. These snoRNAs do not have D
boxes but still have conserved motifs that could be recognized by the modifying enzyme, and each is able to form a specific base-paired interaction with
its target site, specifying the nucleotide to be modified.
The implication is that there is a different snoRNA for each modified position
in a pre-rRNA, except possibly for a few sites that are close enough together
to be dealt with by a single snoRNA. This means that there must be a few hundred snoRNAs per cell. At one time this seemed unlikely because very few
snoRNA genes could be located, but now it appears that only a fraction of all
the snoRNAs are transcribed from these standard genes, most being specified
by sequences within the introns of other genes and released by cutting up the
intron after splicing (Figure 12.41B).

RNA editing
Because rRNAs and tRNAs are noncoding, chemical modifications to their
nucleotides affect only the structural features and, possibly, catalytic activities of the molecules. With mRNAs the situation is very different: chemical
modification has the potential to change the coding properties of the transcript, resulting in an equivalent alteration in the amino acid sequence of the
protein that is specified. This is called RNA editing. A notable example of RNA
editing occurs with the human mRNA for apolipoprotein B. The gene for this
protein codes for a 4563-amino-acid polypeptide, called apolipoprotein
B100, which is synthesized in liver cells and secreted into the bloodstream
where it transports lipids around the body. A related protein, apolipoprotein
B48, is made by intestinal cells. This protein is only 2153 amino acids in
length and is synthesized from an edited version of the mRNA for the fulllength protein (Figure 12.42). In intestinal cells this mRNA is modified by

Although not common, RNA editing occurs in a number of different organisms
and includes a variety of different nucleotide changes (Table 12.5). Some editing events have a significant impact on the organism: in humans, RNA editing
is partly responsible for the generation of antibody diversity (Section 14.2.1)
and has also been implicated in control of the HIV-1 infection cycle. One particularly interesting type of RNA editing is the deamination of adenosine to
inosine, which is carried out by enzymes called adenosine deaminases acting
on RNA (ADARs). Some of the target mRNAs for these enzymes are selectively
edited at a limited number of positions. These positions are apparently specified by double-stranded segments of the pre-mRNA, formed by base pairing
between the modification site and sequences from adjacent introns. This type
of editing occurs, for example, during processing of the mRNAs for mammalian glutamate receptors. There is evidence that ADAR editing is closely
linked with RNA synthesis, as some nucleotides within introns are edited
(indicating that editing occurs before intron splicing) and editing efficiency is
reduced if changes are artificially made to the CTD of RNA polymerase II.
Selective editing contrasts with the second type of modification carried out
by ADARs, in which the target molecules become extensively deaminated,
over 50% of the adenosines in the RNA becoming converted to inosines. This
hyperediting has so far been observed mainly, but not exclusively, with viral
RNAs and is thought to occur by chance, these RNAs adopting base-paired
structures that fortuitously act as substrates for ADAR. It may, however, have
physiological importance in the etiology of diseases caused by the edited
viruses. This possibility is raised by the discovery that viral RNAs associated
with persistent measles infections (as opposed to the more usual transient
version of the disease) are hyperedited.
The above examples of RNA editing are relatively straightforward events
which, with the exception of hyperediting, lead to nucleotide changes at a

single or limited number of positions in selected mRNAs. More complex
types of RNA editing are also known:
G

Pan-editing involves the extensive insertion of nucleotides into abbreviated RNAs in order to produce functional molecules. It is particularly
common in the mitochondria of trypanosomes. Many of the RNAs transcribed in trypanosome mitochondria are specified by cryptogenes—
sequences lacking some of the nucleotides present in the mature RNAs.
The pre-RNAs transcribed from these cryptogenes are processed by multiple insertions of U nucleotides, at positions defined by short guide
RNAs. These are short RNAs that can base-pair to the pre-RNA and which
contain As at the positions where Us must be inserted (Figure 12.43).

G

Less extensive insertional editing occurs with some viral RNAs. For example, the paramyxovirus P gene gives rise to at least two different proteins
because of the insertion of Gs at specific positions in the mRNA. These
insertions are not specified by guide RNAs: instead they are added by the
RNA polymerase as the mRNA is being synthesized.

G

Polyadenylation editing is seen with many animal mitochondrial
mRNAs. Five of the mRNAs transcribed from the human mitochondrial
genome end with just a U or UA, rather than with one of the termination
codons (UAA and UAG in the human mitochondrial genetic code).
Polyadenylation converts the terminal U or UA into UAAAA…, and so creates a termination codon. This is just one of several features that appear to
have evolved in order to make vertebrate mitochondrial genomes as small
as possible.

12.2.6 Degradation of eukaryotic RNAs
Eukaryotic mRNAs are longer lived than their bacterial counterparts, with
half-lives of, on average, 10–20 minutes for yeast mRNA and several hours for
mammalian mRNA. Within individual cells the variations are almost equally
striking: some yeast mRNAs have half-lives of only 1 minute whereas for others the figure is more like 35 minutes. These observations raise two questions:
What are the processes for mRNA degradation? And how are these processes
controlled?
Removal
of the
poly(A) tail

Eukaryotes have diverse mechanisms for RNA degradation
Among eukaryotes, most progress in understanding mRNA degradation has
been made with yeast. At least four pathways have been identified. One of
these involves a multiprotein complex called the exosome, which degrades
transcripts in the 3¢Æ5¢ direction and contains nucleases related to the
enzymes of the bacterial degradosome. Exosomes are probably also present
in mammalian cells and are clearly important, but they are not particularly
well studied. Their role may not be in mRNA degradation per se, but in monitoring polyadenylation and ensuring that transcripts that are about to leave
the nucleus have an appropriate poly(A) tail.
Rather more is known about two other eukaryotic mRNA degradation
processes. The first of these is deadenylation-dependent decapping (Figure
12.44), which is triggered by removal of the poly(A) tail, possibly by exonuclease-mediated cleavage or possibly by loss of the polyadenylate-binding
protein which stabilizes the tail (Section 12.2.1). Poly(A) tail removal is followed by cleavage of the 5¢ cap by the decapping enzyme Dcp1p. Decapping
prevents the mRNA from being translated (Section 13.2.2) and so ends its

functional life. The mRNA then undergoes rapid exonuclease digestion from
its 5¢ end. Whether or not an individual mRNA is degraded is probably determined by the ability of Dcp1p to gain access to the cap structure, which in
turn depends on the association between the cap and the proteins that bind
to it in order to initiate translation (Section 13.2.2). Degradation is also
influenced, at least with some yeast mRNAs, by sequences called instability
elements, located within the transcript. The importance of these sequences
has been demonstrated by experiments in which an element is artificially
deleted, which leads to increased translation and reduced degradation of
the mRNA.
The second well-studied system for degradation of eukaryotic mRNAs is
called nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD), or mRNA surveillance. The
first of these names gives a clue to its function, because in molecular biology
jargon a “nonsense” sequence is a termination codon. NMD results in the
specific degradation of mRNAs that have a termination codon at an incorrect
position, either because the gene has undergone a mutation or as a result of
incorrect splicing. The incorrect codon is thought to be detected by a “surveillance” mechanism that involves a complex of proteins which scans the
mRNA and somehow is able to distinguish between the correct termination
codon, located at the end of the coding region of the transcript, and one that
is in the wrong place (Figure 12.45A). There are a number of conceptual difficulties with this model because it is not easy to imagine how the surveillance complex could discriminate between correct and incorrect termination codons. Current hypotheses are based on the demonstration that the
correct termination codon is recognized as aberrant if the transcript is engineered so that an exon–intron boundary is placed downstream of this
termination codon (Figure 12.45B). The surveillance enzymes may therefore
use exon–intron boundaries as orientation positions in order to distinguish
the correct termination codon, which is usually downstream from the last
intron. Alternative schemes have also been proposed, in which importance is
placed not on the position of the termination codon but on the precise
nature of the events involved in termination of translation at a premature

stop codon compared with one that is at its correct position. Whatever the
mechanism, identification of an incorrect termination codon induces cap
cleavage and 5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease degradation, without prior removal of the
poly(A) tail, by proteins different to those involved in deadenylation-dependent decapping. Although NMD is designed primarily to degrade mRNAs that
have become altered by mutation or have been incorrectly spliced, there is
evidence that the pathway is also responsible for degradation of normal
mRNAs, but probably not in a way that leads to control over expression of
any individual gene.

RNA silencing was first identified as a means of destroying invading
viral RNA
The systems described above are used by eukaryotic cells to degrade endogenous mRNAs. For several years it has been known that eukaryotes also possess other RNA degradation mechanisms that protect their cells from attack
by foreign RNAs such as the genomes of viruses. Originally called RNA silencing, this process is already familiar to us under its alternative name of RNA
interference, as its underlying mechanism has been utilized by genome
researchers as a means of inactivating selected genes in order to study their
function (Section 5.2.2).
The target for RNA silencing must be double stranded, which excludes cellular mRNAs but encompasses viral genomes, many of which are either doublestranded RNA in their native state or replicate via a double-stranded RNA
intermediate (Section 9.1.2). The double-stranded RNA is recognized by
binding proteins that form an attachment site for a ribonuclease called Dicer,
which cuts the molecule into short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21–28
nucleotides in length (Figure 12.46). This inactivates the virus genome, but
what if the virus genes have already been transcribed? If this has occurred
then the harmful effects of the virus will already have been initiated and RNA
silencing would appear to have failed in its attempt to protect the cell from
damage. One of the more remarkable discoveries of recent years has revealed
a second stage of the interference process that is directed specifically at the
viral mRNAs. The siRNAs produced by cleavage of the viral genome are separated into individual strands, one strand of each siRNA subsequently basepairing to any viral mRNAs that are present in the cell. The double-stranded
regions that are formed are target sites for assembly of the RNA induced
silencing complex (RISC), which includes an RNA-binding protein of the
Argonaut family and a nuclease (which may or may not be Argonaut itself),
which cleaves and hence silences the mRNA.
The work which resulted in the initial description of the molecular process
underlying RNA interference was carried out in the late 1990s with C. elegans. Since then, RNA interference has been shown to occur in all eukaryotes, with a few exceptions including S. cerevisiae, and interference has been
linked to various events that involve RNA degradation but which were previously thought to be unrelated. For example, the movement of some types
of transposable element involves a double-stranded RNA intermediate
which can be degraded by a process now known to be RNA interference. This
is one way in which eukaryotes prevent the wholesale proliferation of transposons within their genomes. Genetic engineers had also been puzzled by
the ability of some organisms, especially plants, to silence new genes that
had been inserted into their genomes by cloning techniques. We now know

Figure 12.47 RNA interference explains
why transgenes are sometimes inactive.
For clarity, the mRNA and antisense RNA are
shown being transcribed from different
copies of the inserted transgene. They could
also come from a single transgene that is
transcribed from both its own promoter and
an endogenous promoter.

that this type of silencing can occur if the transgene is inserted, by chance,
upstream of a promoter that directs synthesis of an antisense RNA copy of
all or part of the gene, this RNA then base-pairing with the sense mRNA produced from the transgene’s own promoter to form a double-stranded RNA
that triggers the RNA interference pathway (Figure 12.47). Other phenomena in diverse organisms, variously known as quelling, cosuppression, and
posttranscriptional gene silencing, are all now known to be different guises
of RNA interference.

Figure 12.48 The microRNA interference

In many organisms, more than one type of Dicer protein has been identified.
Drosophila melanogaster, for example, has two related Dicer enzymes, and
Arabidopsis thaliana has four. The multiplicity of Dicer proteins with slightly
different properties alerts us to the possibility that there might be additional
RNA degradation processes related to, but perhaps different from, the form of
RNA interference described above. It turns out that the second type of Dicer
in Drosophila works not with the double-stranded RNAs produced by the
pathway illustrated in Figure 12.46, but with microRNAs (miRNAs), which are
coded by the fruit-fly genome and synthesized by RNA polymerase II.
MicroRNAs are initially synthesized as precursor molecules called foldback
RNAs, this name indicating that these RNAs can form intrastrand base pairs
resulting in one or more internal hairpin structures (Figure 12.48). Within the
nucleus these foldback RNAs are cut by the enzyme Drosha into individual
hairpins that are transported into the cytoplasm. The double-stranded RNA
component of the stem then stimulates the RNA interference pathway, with
the second of the two Drosophila Dicer enzymes cleaving the molecule into
miRNAs approximately 21 nucleotides in length. Each miRNA is complementary to part of a cellular mRNA and hence base-pairs with this target, stimulating assembly of a microribonucleoprotein (miRNP) complex which is
functionally identical to the RISC and contains many of the same proteins.
This leads to cleavage of the mRNA. Often the miRNA annealing site is present in the 3¢ untranslated region of the target mRNA, sometimes in multiple
copies (Figure 12.49). Cleavage by the miRNP therefore does not disrupt the
coding region of the mRNA, but will lead to detachment of the poly(A) tail.
This might interfere with the process for translation initiation, which involves
the poly(A) tail (Section 13.2.2), or it might target the mRNA for degradation
by the deadenylation-dependent decapping pathway. Whatever the precise
mechanism, cleavage by the miRNP leads to the mRNA being silenced.

Synthesis and Processing of Eukaryotic RNA

The first miRNA silencing system to be characterized involved the C. elegans
genes called lin-4 and let-7, both of which code for foldback RNAs that generate miRNAs after cleavage by Dicer. A mutation in either of these two genes
causes defects in the worm’s development pathway, indicating that this type
of RNA degradation is not simply a means of getting rid of unwanted or
potentially harmful mRNAs, but instead plays a fundamental role in regulation of genome expression. Further support for this notion was provided by
other studies of C. elegans miRNAs, which revealed that these molecules are
involved in biological events as diverse as cell death, specification of neuron
cell types, and control of fat storage. Genome analysis shows that most animals have the capacity to synthesize at least 100 to 200 different miRNAs, and
possibly many more. Although as yet very few of the targets for these miRNAs
have been identified, the miRNA system is clearly emerging as a wide-ranging and extremely important aspect of genome regulation. In the past, the
focus has largely been on the way in which genome expression is regulated by
proteins, and the discovery that RNA molecules might be equally important
in this regard has resulted in a major shift in our perception of how control is
exerted over the composition of a cell’s proteome.

12.2.7 Transport of RNA within the eukaryotic cell
In a typical mammalian cell, about 14% of the total RNA is present in the
nucleus. About 80% of this nuclear fraction is RNA that is being processed
before leaving for the cytoplasm. The other 20% is snRNAs and snoRNAs,
playing an active role in the processing events, at least some of these molecules having already been to the cytoplasm where they were coated with protein molecules before being transported back into the nucleus. In other
words, eukaryotic RNAs are continually being moved from nucleus to cytoplasm and possibly back to the nucleus again.
The only way for RNAs to leave or enter the nucleus is via one of the many
nuclear pore complexes that cover the nuclear membrane (Figure 12.50).
Initially looked upon as little more than a hole in the membrane, pore complexes are now regarded as complex structures that play an active role in
movement of molecules into and out of the nucleus. Small molecules can
move unimpeded through a pore complex but RNAs and most proteins are
too large to diffuse through unaided and so have to be transported across by
an energy-dependent process. As in many biochemical systems, the energy is
obtained by hydrolysis of one of the high-energy phosphate–phosphate
bonds in a ribonucleotide triphosphate, in this case by converting GTP to
GDP (other processes use ATPÆADP). Energy generation is carried out by a
protein called Ran, and transport requires receptor proteins called karyopherins, or exportins and importins depending on the direction of their
transport activity. There are at least 20 different human karyopherins, each
responsible for the transport of a different class of molecule—mRNA, rRNA,
and so on. Examples are exportin-t, which has been identified as the karyopherin for export of tRNAs in yeasts and mammals. Transfer RNAs are directly
recognized by exportin-t, but other types of RNA are probably exported by
protein-specific karyopherins which recognize the proteins bound to the
RNA, rather than the RNA itself. This also appears to be the case for import of
snRNA from cytoplasm to nucleus, which makes use of importin b, a component of one of the protein-transport pathways.
Export of mRNAs is triggered by completion of the splicing pathway, possibly
through the action of the protein called Yra1p in yeast and Aly in animals.

Figure 12.50 Eukaryotic RNAs must be
transported through the nuclear pore
complexes. In eukaryotes, rRNAs, tRNAs,
and mRNAs are transported from the
nucleus to the cytoplasm, where these
molecules carry out their cellular functions.
At least some of the snRNAs and snoRNAs
are also transported to the cytoplasm,
where they are coated with proteins before
returning to the nucleus to carry out their
roles in RNA processing. The nuclear pore is
not simply a hole in the nuclear membrane.
It contains a protein assembly comprising a
ring embedded in the pore, with structures
radiating into both the nucleus and the
cytoplasm. Not shown in this diagram is the
central channel complex, a 12 kDa protein
that is thought to reside in the channel that
connects the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
There are thought to be approximately
3000 pores on the surface of a nucleus in
an animal cell.

Once outside the nucleus, there are mechanisms that ensure that mRNAs are
transported to their appropriate places in the cell. It is not known to what
extent protein localization within the cell is due to translation of an mRNA at
a specific position or to movement of the protein after it has been synthesized, but it is clear that at least some mRNAs are translated at defined places.
For example, those mRNAs coding for proteins that are to be transferred into
a mitochondrion are translated by ribosomes located on the surface of the
organelle. It is assumed that protein “address tags” are attached to mRNAs in
order to direct them to their correct locations after they are transported out of
the nucleus, but very little is known about this process.

Summary
Structural studies are beginning to reveal the precise nature of the contacts
formed between an RNA polymerase, the template DNA, and the RNA transcript during the elongation stage of transcription. The RNA polymerase
does not synthesize its transcript at a constant rate. Instead, synthesis is discontinuous, with periods of rapid elongation interspersed by brief pauses
during which the active site of the polymerase undergoes a slight structural
rearrangement. Termination of bacterial transcripts can occur by either of
two methods, one requiring an ancillary protein called Rho. Bacteria possess
various mechanisms for regulating termination, either by reading through
termination signals so downstream sequences are transcribed, which is central to expression of the l genome, or by stopping transcription before a gene
or operon is transcribed if the gene products are not required. Ribosomal
and transfer RNAs in bacteria are initially synthesized as precursor molecules which are processed by cutting and trimming events to release the
functional RNAs. These RNAs are also chemically modified at various
nucleotide positions. A variety of enzymes are involved in the controlled
degradation of bacterial RNAs. In eukaryotes, the mRNAs made by RNA polymerase II are capped by addition of 7-methylguanosine to the 5¢ end, and
polyadenylated at the 3¢ end by addition of a series of adenine nucleotides.
Many eukaryotic pre-mRNAs contain introns which are spliced from the
transcripts by a complex pathway involving the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins acting in a structure called the spliceosome. Alternative splicing
pathways enable more than one protein to be synthesized from a single
gene, and are important in various physiological processes including sex
determination in Drosophila melanogaster. Eukaryotic pre-rRNAs and pretRNAs may also contain introns. Those in pre-rRNAs are self-splicing and
hence are examples of ribozymes. Eukaryotic rRNA is chemically modified by
a process in which small nucleolar RNAs act as guides to indicate the positions at which modifications must be made. Chemical modification of
mRNA is less common but results in alteration of the coding specification, as
occurs during synthesis of the liver version and intestinal version of
apolipoprotein B in mammals. Eukaryotes have diverse mechanisms for
RNA degradation, including the process called RNA silencing, or RNA interference, in which small interfering RNAs and microRNAs degrade and hence
silence invading viral RNAs and mRNAs transcribed from cellular genes
whose products are no longer required.

Protein Synthesis
13.3 Posttranslational Processing of Proteins

When you have read Chapter 13, you should be able to:
Draw the general structure of a tRNA and explain how this structure enables the tRNA to play both
a physical and an informational role during protein synthesis.
Describe how an amino acid becomes attached to a tRNA, and outline the processes that ensure
that combinations are formed between the correct pairs of amino acids and tRNAs.
Explain how codons and anticodons interact, and discuss the influence of wobble on this
interaction.
Outline the techniques that have been used to study the structure of the ribosome, and
summarize the information that has resulted from these studies.
Give a detailed description of the process of translation in bacteria and eukaryotes, with emphasis
on the roles of the various translation factors.
Describe the experimental evidence that has led to the conclusion that peptidyl transferase is
a ribozyme.
Explain how translation is regulated and give an outline of the unusual events, such as
frameshifting, that can occur during the elongation phase.
Explain why posttranslational processing of proteins is an important component of the genome
expression pathway, and describe the key features of protein folding, protein processing by
proteolytic cleavage and chemical modification, and intein splicing.
Describe the major processes responsible for protein degradation in bacteria and eukaryotes.

The end result of genome expression is the proteome, the collection of functioning proteins synthesized by a living cell. The identity and relative abundance of the individual proteins in a proteome represents a balance between
the synthesis of new proteins and the degradation of existing ones. The biochemical capabilities of the proteome can also be changed by chemical modification and other processing events. The combination of synthesis, degradation, and modification/processing enables the proteome to meet the
changing requirements of the cell and to respond to external stimuli.

In this chapter we will study the synthesis, processing, and degradation of the
components of the proteome. To understand protein synthesis we will first
examine the role of tRNAs in decoding the genetic code and then investigate
the events, occurring at the ribosome, that result in polymerization of amino
acids into polypeptides. The ribosomal events are sometimes looked upon as
the final stage in expression of the genome but the polypeptide that is initially
synthesized is inactive until it has been folded, and may also have to undergo
cutting and chemical modification before it becomes functional. We will
study these processing events in Section 13.3. At the end of the chapter we
will investigate how the cell degrades proteins that it no longer requires.

it attaches.

13.1 The Role of tRNA in Protein Synthesis
Transfer RNAs play the central role in translation. They are the adaptor molecules, whose existence was predicted by Francis Crick in 1956, which form
the link between the mRNA and the polypeptide that is being synthesized.
This is both a physical link, tRNAs binding to both the mRNA and the growing polypeptide, and an informational link, tRNAs ensuring that the
polypeptide being synthesized has the amino acid sequence that is denoted,
via the genetic code, by the sequence of nucleotides in the mRNA (Figure
13.1). To understand how tRNAs play this dual role we must examine aminoacylation, the process by which the correct amino acid is attached to each
tRNA, and codon–anticodon recognition, the interaction between tRNA
and mRNA.

13.1.1 Aminoacylation: the attachment of amino acids
to tRNAs
Bacteria contain 30–45 different tRNAs and eukaryotes have up to 50 tRNAs.
As only 20 amino acids are designated by the genetic code, this means that all
organisms have at least some isoaccepting tRNAs, different tRNAs that are
specific for the same amino acid. The terminology used when describing
tRNAs is to indicate the amino acid specificity with a superscript suffix, using
the numbers 1, 2, and so on, to distinguish different isoacceptors: for example, two tRNAs specific for glycine would be written as tRNAGly1 and tRNAGly2.

All tRNAs have a similar structure
The smallest tRNAs are only 74 nucleotides in length, and the largest are rarely
more than 90 nucleotides. Because of their small size, and because it is possible to purify individual tRNAs, they were among the first nucleic acids to be
sequenced, way back in 1965 by Robert Holley and colleagues. The sequences
revealed one unexpected feature, that as well as the standard RNA nucleotides
(A, C, G, and U), tRNAs contain a number of modified nucleotides, 5–10 in any
particular tRNA, with over 50 different modifications known altogether
(Section 12.1.3).
Examination of the first tRNA sequence, for tRNAAla of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, showed that the molecule could adopt various base-paired secondary
structures. After more tRNAs had been sequenced, it became clear that one
particular structure could be taken up by all of them. This is the cloverleaf
(Figure 13.2), and has the following features:
G

The acceptor arm is formed by seven base pairs between the 5¢ and 3¢
ends of the molecule. The amino acid is attached to the extreme 3¢ end of

The cloverleaf structure can be formed by virtually all tRNAs, the main exceptions being the tRNAs used in vertebrate mitochondria, which are coded by
the mitochondrial genome and which sometimes lack parts of the structure.
An example is the human mitochondrial tRNASer, which has no D arm. As
well as the conserved secondary structure, the identities of nucleotides at
some positions are completely invariant (always the same nucleotide) or
semi-invariant (always a purine or always a pyrimidine), and the positions of
the modified nucleotides are almost always the same.

D loop

Many of the invariant nucleotide positions are important in the tertiary structure of tRNA. X-ray crystallography studies have shown that nucleotides in the
D and TYC loops form base pairs that fold the tRNA into a compact L-shaped
structure (Figure 13.3). Each arm of the L-shape is approximately 7 nm long
and 2 nm in diameter, with the amino acid binding site at the end of one arm
and the anticodon at the end of the other. The additional base pairing means
that the base stacking (see Section 1.1.2) is almost continuous from one end
of the tRNA to the other, providing stability to the structure.

structure of a tRNA. Additional base pairs,
shown in black and mainly between the D
and TYC loops, fold the cloverleaf structure
into this L-shaped configuration. Depending
on its sequence, the V loop might also form

The attachment of amino acids to tRNAs—“charging” in molecular biology
jargon—is the function of the group of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. The chemical reaction that results in aminoacylation occurs in two
steps. An activated amino acid intermediate is first formed by reaction
between the amino acid and ATP, and then the amino acid is transferred to
the 3¢ end of the tRNA, the link being formed between the –COOH group of
the amino acid and the –OH group attached to either the 2¢ or 3¢ carbon on
the sugar of the last nucleotide, which is always an A (Figure 13.4).

Figure 13.4 Aminoacylation of a tRNA.
The result of aminoacylation by a Class II
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase is shown, the
amino acid being attached via its –COOH
group to the 3¢–OH of the terminal
nucleotide of the tRNA. A Class I aminoacyltRNA synthetase attaches the amino acid to
the 2¢–OH group.

With a few exceptions, organisms have 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, one
for each amino acid. This means that groups of isoaccepting tRNAs are
aminoacylated by a single enzyme. Although the basic chemical reaction is
the same for each amino acid, the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases fall into
two distinct groups, Class I and Class II, with several important differences
between them (Table 13.1). In particular, Class I enzymes attach the amino
acid to the 2¢–OH group of the terminal nucleotide of the tRNA, whereas Class
II enzymes attach the amino acid to the 3¢–OH group.
Aminoacylation must be carried out accurately: the correct amino acid must
be attached to the correct tRNA if the rules of the genetic code are to be followed during protein synthesis. It appears that an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has high fidelity for its tRNA, the result of an extensive interaction
between the two, covering some 25 nm2 of surface area and involving the
acceptor arm and anticodon loop of the tRNA, as well as individual
nucleotides in the D and TYC arms. The interaction between enzyme and
amino acid is, of necessity, less extensive, amino acids being much smaller
than tRNAs, and presents greater problems with regard to specificity because
several pairs of amino acids are structurally similar. Errors do therefore occur,
at a very low rate for most amino acids but possibly as frequently as one
aminoacylation in 80 for difficult pairs such as isoleucine and valine. Most
errors are corrected by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase itself, by an editing
process that is distinct from aminoacylation, involving different contacts
with the tRNA.
In most organisms, aminoacylation is carried out by the process just
described, but a few unusual events have been documented. These include a

number of instances where the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase attaches the
incorrect amino acid to a tRNA, this amino acid subsequently being transformed into the correct one by a second, separate chemical reaction. This was
first discovered in the bacterium Bacillus megaterium for synthesis of glutamine–tRNAGln (i.e., glutamine attached to its tRNA). This aminoacylation is
carried out by the enzyme responsible for synthesis of glutamic acid–tRNAGlu,
and initially results in attachment of a glutamic acid to the tRNAGln (Figure
13.5A). This glutamic acid is then converted to glutamine by transamidation
catalyzed by a second enzyme. The same process is used by various other bacteria (although not Escherichia coli) and by the archaea. Some archaea also
use transamidation to synthesize asparagine–tRNAAsn from aspartic acid–
tRNAAsn. In both of these cases, the amino acid that is synthesized by the
modification process is one of the 20 that are specified by the genetic code.
There are also two examples where the modification results in an unusual

amino acid. The first example is the conversion of methionine to N-formylmethionine (Figure 13.5B), producing the special aminoacyl-tRNA used in
initiation of bacterial translation (Section 13.2.2). The second example occurs
in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and results in synthesis of selenocysteine,
which is specified in a context-dependent manner by some 5¢–UGA–3¢ codons
(Section 1.3.2). These codons are recognized by a special tRNASeCys, but there
is no aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that is able to attach selenocysteine to this
tRNA. Instead, the tRNA is aminoacylated with a serine by the seryl-tRNA synthetase, and then modified by replacement of the –OH group of the serine
with an –SeH, to give selenocysteine (Figure 13.5C). The second contextdependent codon reassignment that has been discovered is the occasional
use of 5¢–UAG–3¢ to code for pyrrolysine in archaea (Section 1.3.2). This does
not involve modification of a precharged tRNA. Instead, there is a specific
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase that directly attaches pyrrolysine to the tRNApLys.

13.1.2 Codon–anticodon interactions: the attachment of
tRNAs to mRNA
Aminoacylation represents the first level of specificity displayed by a tRNA.
The second level is the specificity of the interaction between the anticodon of
the tRNA and the mRNA being translated. This specificity ensures that protein synthesis follows the rules of the genetic code (see Figure 1.20).
In principle, codon–anticodon recognition is a straightforward process
involving base pairing between the anticodon of the tRNA and a codon in the
mRNA (Figure 13.6). The specificity of aminoacylation ensures that the tRNA
carries the amino acid denoted by the codon that it pairs with, and the ribosome controls the topology of the interaction in such a way that only a single
triplet of nucleotides is available for pairing. Because base-paired polynucleotides are always antiparallel, and because the mRNA is read in the 5¢Æ3¢
direction, the first nucleotide of the codon pairs with nucleotide 36 of the
tRNA, the second with nucleotide 35, and the third with nucleotide 34.
In practice, codon recognition is complicated by the possibility of wobble.
This is another of the principles of gene expression originally proposed by
Crick and subsequently shown to be correct. Because the anticodon is in a
loop of RNA, the triplet of nucleotides is slightly curved (see Figures 13.2 and
13.3) and so cannot make an entirely uniform alignment with the codon. As a
result, a nonstandard base pair can form between the third nucleotide of the
codon and the first nucleotide (number 34) of the anticodon. This is called
“wobble.” A variety of pairings is possible, especially if the nucleotide at position 34 is modified. In bacteria, the two main features of wobble are:
G

G–U base pairs are permitted. This means that an anticodon with the
sequence 3¢–ooG–5¢ can base-pair with both 5¢–ooC–3¢ and 5¢–ooU–3¢.
Similarly, the anticodon 3¢–ooU–5¢ can base-pair with both 5¢–ooA–3¢ and
5¢–ooG–3¢. The consequence is that rather than needing a different tRNA
for each codon, the four members of a codon family (e.g., 5¢–GCN–3¢, all
coding for alanine) can be decoded by just two tRNAs (Figure 13.7A).

G

Inosine, abbreviated to I, is a modified purine (see Figure 12.18) that can
base-pair with A, C, and U. Inosine can only occur in the tRNA because the
mRNA is not modified in this way. The triplet 3¢–UAI–5¢ is sometimes used
as the anticodon in a tRNAIle molecule because it pairs with 5¢–AUA–3¢,
5¢–AUC–3¢, and 5¢–AUU–3¢ (Figure 13.7B), which form the three-codon
family for this amino acid in the standard genetic code.

Wobble reduces the number of tRNAs needed in a cell by enabling one tRNA
to read two or possibly three codons. Hence bacteria can decode their mRNAs
with as few as 30 tRNAs. Eukaryotes also make use of wobble but in a
restricted way. The human genome, which in this regard is fairly typical of
higher eukaryotes, has 48 tRNAs. Of these, 16 are predicted to use wobble to
decode two codons each, with the remaining 32 being specific for just a single triplet (Figure 13.8). The distinctive features compared with wobble in
bacteria are:
G

G–U wobble is used with eight tRNAs but in every case the wobble
involves an anticodon with the sequence 3¢–ooG–5¢. The alternative version of G–U wobble, where the anticodon sequence is 3¢–ooU–5¢, appears
not to be used in eukaryotes, possibly because this could result in a
tRNAIle with the anticodon 3¢–UAU–5¢ reading the methionine codon
5¢–AUG–3¢ (Figure 13.9). Eukaryotes therefore have a means of preventing
this type of wobble from occurring.

Figure 13.7 Two examples of wobble in
bacteria. (A) Wobble involving a G–U base
pair enables the four-codon family for
alanine to be decoded by just two tRNAs.
Note that wobble involving G–U also
enables accurate decoding of a four-codon
family that specifies two amino acids. For
example, the anticodon 3¢–AAG–5¢ can
decode 5¢–UUC–3¢ and 5¢–UUU–3¢, both

Codons that are not highlighted have their

based largely on examination of the

have been located in the human genome
sequence. The analysis shown here implies
that there are 45 tRNAs in human cells—the
16 for the wobble pairs and 29 singletons.
In fact, there are 48 tRNAs. This is because
three codons thought to be decoded as part
of a wobble pair (5¢–AAU–3¢, 5¢–AUC–3¢,
and 5¢–UAU–3¢) also have their own
individual tRNAs, although these are present

tRNA

Eight other human tRNAs have anticodons containing inosine (3¢–ooI–5¢)
but these decode only 5¢–ooC–3¢ and 5¢–ooU–3¢. The base pairing between
I and A is weak, which means that 5¢–ooA–3¢ codons are only inefficiently
recognized by a 3¢–ooI–5¢ anticodon. To avoid this inefficiency, in every
example of wobble involving inosine in the human tRNA set, the
5¢–ooA–3¢ codon is recognized by a separate tRNA. Note, however, that
recognition by a separate tRNA does not preclude the 5¢–ooA–3¢ codon
from also being decoded by the tRNA containing 3¢–ooI–5¢, albeit inefficiently. This does not compromise the specificity of the genetic code,
because wobble involving inosine is limited to codon families in which all
three triplets that can be decoded by 3¢–ooI–5¢ specify the same amino
acid (see Figure 13.8).

Other genetic systems use more extreme forms of wobble. Human mitochondria, for example, use only 22 tRNAs. With some of these tRNAs the nucleotide
in the wobble position of the anticodon is virtually redundant because it can
base-pair with any nucleotide, enabling all four codons of a family to be recognized by the same tRNA. This phenomenon has been called superwobble.

13.2 The Role of the Ribosome in Protein
Synthesis
An E. coli cell contains approximately 20,000 ribosomes, distributed throughout its cytoplasm. The average human cell contains rather more (nobody has
ever counted them all), some free in the cytoplasm and some attached to the
outer surface of the endoplasmic reticulum, the membranous network of
tubes and vesicles that permeates the cell. Originally, ribosomes were looked

Genomes Chapter 13

27/3/06

Page 393

The Role of the Ribosome in Protein Synthesis

on as passive partners in protein synthesis, merely the structures on which
translation occurs. This view has changed over the years and ribosomes are
now considered to play two active roles in protein synthesis:
G

Ribosomes coordinate protein synthesis by placing the mRNA, aminoacyltRNAs, and associated protein factors in their correct positions relative to
one another.

G

Components of ribosomes, including the rRNAs, catalyze at least some of
the chemical reactions occurring during translation.

To understand how ribosomes play these roles we will first survey the structural features of ribosomes in bacteria and eukaryotes, and then examine the
detailed mechanism for protein synthesis in these two types of organism.

13.2.1 Ribosome structure
Our understanding of ribosome structure has gradually developed over the last
50 years as more and more powerful techniques have been applied to the problem. Originally called “microsomes,” ribosomes were first observed in the early
decades of the twentieth century as tiny particles almost beyond the resolving
power of light microscopy. In the 1940s and 1950s, the first electron micrographs showed that bacterial ribosomes are oval shaped, with dimensions of
29 ¥ 21 nm, rather smaller than eukaryotic ribosomes, the latter varying a little
in size depending on species but averaging about 32 ¥ 22 nm. In the mid-1950s,
the discovery that ribosomes are the sites of protein synthesis stimulated
attempts to define the structures of these particles in greater detail.

Ultracentrifugation was used to measure the sizes of ribosomes and
their components
The initial progress in understanding the detailed structure of the ribosome
came not from observing them with the electron microscope but by analyzing their components by ultracentrifugation (Technical Note 7.1). Intact ribosomes have sedimentation coefficients of 80S for eukaryotes and 70S for bacteria, and each can be broken down into smaller components (Figure 13.10):
G

Each ribosome comprises two subunits. In eukaryotes these subunits
have sedimentation coefficients of 60S and 40S; in bacteria they are 50S
and 30S. Note that sedimentation coefficients are not additive because
they depend on shape as well as mass: it is perfectly acceptable for the
intact ribosome to have an S value less than the sum of its two subunits.

G

The large subunit contains three rRNAs in eukaryotes (the 28S, 5.8S, and
5S rRNAs) but only two in bacteria (23S and 5S rRNAs). In bacteria the
equivalent of the eukaryotic 5.8S rRNA is contained within the 23S rRNA.

G

The small subunit contains a single rRNA in both types of organism: an
18S rRNA in eukaryotes and a 16S rRNA in bacteria.

G

Both subunits contain a variety of ribosomal proteins, the numbers of
these detailed in Figure 13.10. The ribosomal proteins of the small subunit
are called S1, S2, and so on; those of the large subunit are L1, L2, and so
on. There is just one of each protein per ribosome, except for L7 and L12,
which are present as dimers.

Probing the fine structure of the ribosome
Once the basic composition of eukaryotic and bacterial ribosomes had been
worked out, attention was focused on the way in which the various rRNAs

and proteins fit together. Important information was provided by the first
rRNA sequences, comparisons between these identifying conserved regions
that can base-pair to form complex two-dimensional structures (Figure
13.11). This suggested that the rRNAs provide a scaffolding within the ribosome, to which the proteins are attached, an interpretation that underemphasizes the active role that rRNAs play in protein synthesis but which
nonetheless was a useful foundation on which to base subsequent research.
Much of that subsequent research has concentrated on the bacterial ribosome, which is smaller than the eukaryotic version and available in large
amounts from extracts of cells grown to high density in liquid cultures. A number of technical approaches have been used to study the bacterial ribosome:

Nuclease protection experiments (Section 7.1.1) enable contacts

G

Protein–protein cross-linking identifies pairs or groups of proteins that
are located close to one another in the ribosome.

G

Electron microscopy has gradually become more sophisticated, enabling
the overall structure of the ribosome to be resolved in greater detail. For
example, innovations such as immunoelectron microscopy, in which
ribosomes are labeled with antibodies specific for individual ribosomal
proteins before examination, have been used to locate the positions of
these proteins on the surface of the ribosome.

G

Site-directed hydroxyl radical probing makes use of the ability of Fe(II)
ions to generate hydroxyl radicals that cleave RNA phosphodiester bonds
located within 1 nm of the site of radical production. This technique has
been used to determine the exact positioning of ribosomal proteins in the
E. coli ribosome. For example, to determine the position of S5, different
amino acids within this protein were labeled with Fe(II) and hydroxyl radicals induced in reconstituted ribosomes. The positions at which the 16S
rRNA was cleaved were then used to infer the topology of the rRNA in the
vicinity of S5 protein (Figure 13.12).

The Role of the Ribosome in Protein Synthesis

In recent years these techniques have been increasingly supplemented by
X-ray crystallography (Technical Note 11.1), which has been responsible for
the most exciting insights into ribosome structure. Analyzing the massive
amounts of X-ray diffraction data that are produced by crystals of an object
as large as a ribosome is a huge task, particularly at the level needed to
obtain a structure that is detailed enough to be informative about the way in
which the ribosome works. This challenge has been met, and structures have
been deduced for ribosomal proteins bound to their segments of rRNA, for
the large and small subunits, and for the entire bacterial ribosome attached
to mRNA and tRNAs. As well as revealing the structure of the ribosome
(Figure 13.13), this recent explosion of information has had an important
impact on our understanding of the translation process.

13.2.2 Initiation of translation
Although ribosomal architecture is similar in bacteria and eukaryotes, there
are distinctions in the way in which translation is carried out in the two types
of organism. The most important of these differences occurs during the first
stage of translation, when the ribosome is assembled on the mRNA at a position upstream of the initiation codon.

Initiation in bacteria requires an internal ribosome binding site
The main difference between initiation of translation in bacteria and eukaryotes is that in bacteria the translation initiation complex is built up directly at
the initiation codon, the point at which protein synthesis will begin, whereas

the ribosome binding site has the

upstream of the initiation codon.

When not actively participating in protein synthesis, ribosomes dissociate
into their subunits, which remain in the cytoplasm waiting to be used for a
new round of translation. In bacteria, the process initiates when a small subunit, in conjunction with the translation initiation factor IF-3 (Table 13.2),
attaches to the ribosome binding site (also called the Shine–Dalgarno
sequence). This is a short target site, consensus 5¢–AGGAGGU–3¢ in E. coli
(Table 13.3), located about 3–10 nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon,
the point at which translation will begin (Figure 13.14). The ribosome binding
site is complementary to a region at the 3¢ end of the 16S rRNA, the one present in the small subunit, and it is thought that base pairing between the two
is involved in the attachment of the small subunit to the mRNA.

Attachment to the ribosome binding site positions the small subunit of the
ribosome over the initiation codon (Figure 13.15). This codon is usually
5¢–AUG–3¢, which codes for methionine, although 5¢–GUG–3¢ and 5¢–UUG–3¢
are sometimes used. All three codons can be recognized by the same initiator
tRNA, the last two by wobble. This initiator tRNA is the one that was aminoacylated with methionine and subsequently modified by conversion of the
methionine to N-formylmethionine (see Figure 13.5B). The modification
attaches a formyl group (–COH) to the amino group, which means that only
the carboxyl group of the initiator methionine is free to participate in peptide
bond formation. This ensures that polypeptide synthesis can take place only
in the NÆC direction. The initiator tRNAMet is brought to the small subunit of
the ribosome by a second initiation factor, IF-2, along with a molecule of GTP,
the latter acting as a source of energy for the final step of initiation. The formyl
group remains attached until translation has proceeded into the elongation
phase but it is then removed from the growing polypeptide, either on its own
or along with the rest of the initial methionine. Note that the initiator tRNAMet
is only able to decode the initiation codon; it cannot enter the complete ribosome during the elongation phase of translation during which internal
5¢–AUG–3¢ codons are recognized by a different tRNAMet carrying an unmodified methionine. The discrimination between these tRNAs appears to center
on two unusual features of the initiator molecule. First, unlike all other bacterial tRNAs that have been sequenced, the initiator tRNA has a run of three G–C
base pairs in its anticodon stem that aid the attachment of this tRNA to the
small subunit. Second, the 5¢ nucleotide, which in most tRNAs participates in
the first base pair of the acceptor stem (see Figure 13.2) is unpaired in the initiator tRNA. This unusual feature acts as a signal for the enzyme that converts
the attached methionine to N-formylmethionine, and possibly also prevents
the initiator tRNA from entering the ribosome during the elongation phase.
Completion of the initiation phase occurs when IF-1 binds to the initiation
complex. The precise role of IF-1 is unclear (see Table 13.2), but it may induce
a conformational change in the initiation complex, enabling the large subunit of the ribosome to attach. Attachment of the large subunit requires
energy, which is generated by hydrolysis of the bound GTP, and results in
release of the initiation factors.

Only a small number of eukaryotic mRNAs have internal ribosome binding

The first step involves assembly of the preinitiation complex. This structure
comprises the 40S subunit of the ribosome, a “ternary complex” made up of
the initiation factor eIF-2 bound to the initiator tRNAMet and a molecule of
GTP, and three additional initiation factors, eIF-1, eIF-1A, and eIF-3. As in
bacteria, the initiator tRNA is distinct from the normal tRNAMet that recognizes internal 5¢–AUG–3¢ codons but, unlike bacteria, it is aminoacylated with
normal methionine, not the formylated version.

(B) The preinitiation complex scans along
the mRNA until it reaches the initiation
codon, which is recognizable because it is
located within the Kozak consensus
sequence. Scanning is aided by eIF-4A and
eIF-4B, which are thought to have helicase
activity. It is probable that eIF-3 remains
attached to the preinitiation complex during
scanning, as shown here. It is not clear
whether eIF-4E and eIF-4G also remain
attached at this stage. Note that scanning is
an energy-dependent process that requires
hydrolysis of ATP. Abbreviation: M,
methionine.

After assembly, the preinitiation complex associates with the 5¢ end of the
mRNA. This step requires the cap binding complex (sometimes called eIF4F), which comprises the initiation factors eIF-4A, eIF-4E, and eIF-4G. The
contact with the cap might be made by eIF-4E alone (as shown in Figure
13.16) or might involve a more general interaction with the cap binding complex. The factor eIF-4G acts as a bridge between eIF-4E, bound to the cap, and
eIF-3, attached to the preinitiation complex. The result is that the preinitiation complex becomes attached to the 5¢ region of the mRNA. Attachment of
the preinitiation complex to the mRNA is also influenced by the poly(A) tail,
at the distant 3¢ end of the mRNA. This interaction is thought to be mediated
by the polyadenylate-binding protein (PADP), which is attached to the
poly(A) tail (Section 12.2.1). In yeast and plants it has been shown that PADP
can form an association with eIF-4G, this association requiring that the
mRNA bends back on itself. With artificially uncapped mRNAs, the PADP
interaction is sufficient to load the preinitiation complex onto the 5¢ end of
the mRNA, but under normal circumstances the cap structure and poly(A)
tail probably work together. The poly(A) tail could have an important regulatory role, as the length of the tail appears to be correlated with the extent of
initiation that occurs with a particular mRNA.
After becoming attached to the 5¢ end of the mRNA, the initiation complex,
as it is now called, has to scan along the mRNA molecule and find the initiation codon. The leader regions of eukaryotic mRNAs can be several tens, or
even hundreds, of nucleotides in length and often contain regions that form
hairpins and other base-paired structures. These are probably removed by a
combination of eIF-4A and eIF-4B. eIF-4A, and possibly also eIF-4B, has a
helicase activity and so is able to break intramolecular base pairs in the
mRNA, freeing the passage for the initiation complex (Figure 13.16B). The initiation codon, which is usually 5¢–AUG–3¢ in eukaryotes, is recognizable
because it is contained in a short consensus sequence, 5¢–ACCAUGG–3¢,
referred to as the Kozak consensus.
Once the initiation complex is positioned over the initiation codon, the large
subunit of the ribosome attaches. As in bacteria, this requires hydrolysis of
GTP and leads to release of the initiation factors. Two final initiation factors
are involved at this stage: eIF-5, which aids release of the other factors, and
eIF-6, which is associated with the unbound large subunit and prevents it
from attaching to a small subunit in the cytoplasm.

Initiation of eukaryotic translation without scanning
The scanning system for initiation of translation does not apply to every
eukaryotic mRNA. This was first recognized with the picornaviruses, a group

Genomes Chapter 13

27/3/06

12:43 pm

Page 399

The Role of the Ribosome in Protein Synthesis

of viruses with RNA genomes which includes the human poliovirus and rhinovirus, the latter being responsible for the common cold. Transcripts from
these viruses are not capped but instead have an internal ribosome entry
site (IRES) which is similar in function to the ribosome binding site of bacteria, although the sequences of IRESs and their positions relative to the initiation codon are more variable than the bacterial versions. The presence of
IRESs on their transcripts means that picornaviruses can block protein synthesis in the host cell by inactivating the cap binding complex, without affecting translation of their own transcripts, although this is not a normal part of
the infection strategy of all picornaviruses.

Remarkably, no virus proteins are required for recognition of an IRES by a
host ribosome. In other words, the normal eukaryotic cell possesses proteins
and/or other factors that enable it to initiate translation by the IRES method.
Because of their variability, IRESs are difficult to identify by inspection of
DNA sequences, but it is becoming clear that a few nuclear gene transcripts
possess them and that these are translated, at least under some circumstances, via their IRES rather than by scanning. Examples are the mRNAs for
the mammalian immunoglobulin heavy-chain binding protein and the
Drosophila Antennapedia protein (Section 14.3.4). IRESs are also found on
several mRNAs whose protein products are translated when the cell is put
under stress, for example by exposure to heat, irradiation, or low oxygen conditions. Under these circumstances, cap-dependent translation is globally
suppressed (as described in the next section). The presence of IRESs on the
“survival” mRNAs therefore enables these to undergo preferential translation
at the time when their products are needed.

Regulation of translation initiation
The initiation of translation is an important control point in protein synthesis, at which two different types of regulation can be exerted. The first of
these is global regulation, which involves a general alteration in the amount
of protein synthesis occurring, with all mRNAs translated by the cap mechanism being affected to a similar extent. This is commonly achieved by phosphorylation of eIF-2, which results in repression of translation initiation by
preventing eIF-2 from binding the molecule of GTP that it needs before it
can transport the initiator tRNA to the small subunit of the ribosome.
Phosphorylation of eIF-2 occurs during stresses such as heat shock, when
the overall level of protein synthesis is decreased and IRES-mediated translation takes over.
Transcript-specific regulation involves mechanisms that act on a single transcript or a small group of transcripts coding for related proteins. The most frequently cited example of transcript-specific regulation involves the operons
for the ribosomal protein genes of E. coli (Figure 13.17A). The leader region of
the mRNA transcribed from each operon contains a sequence that acts as a
binding site for one of the proteins coded by the operon. When this protein is
synthesized it can either attach to its position on the ribosomal RNA, or bind
to the leader region of the mRNA. The rRNA attachment is favored and occurs
if there are free rRNAs in the cell. Once all the free rRNAs have been assembled
into ribosomes, the ribosomal protein binds to its mRNA, blocking translation
initiation and hence switching off further synthesis of the ribosomal proteins
coded by that particular mRNA. Similar events involving other mRNAs ensure
that synthesis of each ribosomal protein is coordinated with the amount of
free rRNA in the cell. Other proteins with RNA-binding capability, such as

Initiation of translation of some bacterial mRNAs can also be regulated by
short RNAs which attach to recognition sequences within the mRNAs. This
does not always result in translation being prevented, as some short RNAs
can also activate translation of one or more of their target mRNAs. An example is the E. coli RNA called OxyS, which is 109 nucleotides in length and regulates translation of 40 or so mRNAs. Synthesis of OxyS is activated by hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen compounds which can cause oxidative damage to the cell. Once synthesized, OxyS switches on translation of
some mRNAs whose products help protect the bacterium from oxidative
damage, and switches off translation of other mRNAs whose products would
be deleterious under these circumstances. The structures formed when OxyS
and other short, regulatory RNAs bind to their target mRNAs have been
described, but these do not give us any substantial insights into how the regulatory process is mediated, especially as the structures formed on mRNAs
that are silenced, and which presumably act by blocking access of the small
subunit of the ribosome to the mRNA, are not obviously different from the
structures formed with mRNAs whose translation is activated.

A second example of transcript-specific regulation, one occurring in mammals, involves the mRNA for ferritin, an iron-storage protein (Figure 13.17B).
In the absence of iron, ferritin synthesis is inhibited by proteins that bind to
sequences called iron-response elements located in the leader region of the
ferritin mRNA. The bound proteins block the ribosome as it attempts to scan
along the mRNA in search of the initiation codon. When iron is present, the
binding proteins detach and the mRNA is translated. Interestingly, the mRNA
for a related protein—the transferrin receptor involved in the uptake of
iron—also has iron-response elements, but in this case detachment of the
binding proteins in the presence of iron results not in translation of the
mRNA but in its degradation. This is logical because when iron is present in
the cell, there is less requirement for transferrin receptor activity because
there is less need to import iron from outside.

The main differences between translation in bacteria and in eukaryotes occur
during the initiation phase: the events occurring after the large subunit of the
ribosome becomes associated with the initiation complex are similar in both
types of organism. We can therefore deal with them together, by looking at
what happens in bacteria and referring to the distinctive features of eukaryotic translation where appropriate.

Elongation in bacteria and eukaryotes
Attachment of the large subunit results in two sites at which aminoacyl-tRNAs
can bind. The first of these, the P or peptidyl site, is already occupied by the
initiator tRNAMet, charged with N-formylmethionine or methionine, and
base-paired with the initiation codon. The second site, the A or aminoacyl
site, covers the second codon in the open reading frame (Figure 13.18). The
structures revealed by X-ray crystallography show that these sites are located
in the cavity between the large and small subunits of the ribosome, the
codon–anticodon interaction being associated with the small subunit, and
the aminoacyl end of the tRNA with the large subunit (Figure 13.19).

The A site becomes filled with the appropriate aminoacyl-tRNA, which in
E. coli is brought into position by the elongation factor EF-1A, which ensures
that only tRNAs that carry the correct amino acid are able to enter the ribosome, mischarged tRNAs being rejected at this point. EF-1A is an example of a
G protein, meaning that it binds a molecule of GTP which it can hydrolyze to
release energy. In eukaryotes the equivalent factor is called eEF-1, which is a
complex of four subunits: eEF-1a, eEF-1b, eEF-1d, and eEF-1g (Table 13.4). The
first of these exists in at least two forms, eEF-1a1 and eEF-1a2, which are highly
similar proteins that probably have equivalent functions in different tissues.
Specific contacts between the tRNA, mRNA, and the small subunit rRNA within
the A site ensure that only the correct tRNA is accepted. These contacts are able
to discriminate between a codon–anticodon interaction in which all three base
pairs have formed and one in which one or more mis-pairs are present, the latter signaling that the wrong tRNA is present. This is probably just one part of a
series of safeguards that ensure the accuracy of the translation process.

When the aminoacyl-tRNA has entered the A site, a peptide bond is formed

which releases the amino acid from the initiator tRNAMet and then forms a
peptide bond between this amino acid and the one attached to the second
tRNA. The reaction is energy dependent and requires hydrolysis of the GTP
attached to EF-1A (eEF-1 in eukaryotes). This inactivates EF-1A, which is
ejected from the ribosome and regenerated by EF-1B. A eukaryotic equivalent
of EF-1B has not been identified, and it is possible that one of the subunits of
eEF-1 has the regenerative activity.
Now the dipeptide corresponding to the first two codons in the open reading
frame is attached to the tRNA in the A site. The next step is translocation (see
Figure 13.18), during which the ribosome moves three nucleotides along the
mRNA, so a new codon enters the A site. This moves the dipeptide-tRNA to
the P site, which in turn displaces the deacylated tRNA. In eukaryotes, the
deacylated tRNA is simply ejected from the ribosome, but in bacteria the
deacylated tRNA departs via a third position, the E or exit site. This site was
originally looked on as a simple exit point from the ribosome, but it is now
known to have an important role in ensuring that translocation moves the
ribosome along the mRNA by precisely three nucleotides, thereby ensuring
that the ribosome keeps to the correct reading frame.
Translocation requires hydrolysis of a molecule of GTP and is mediated by
EF-2 in bacteria and by eEF-2 in eukaryotes. Electron microscopy of ribosomes
at different intermediate stages in translocation shows that, during translocation, the ribosome adopts a less compact structure, with the two subunits
rotating slightly in opposite directions, opening up the space between them
and enabling the ribosome to slide along the mRNA. Translocation results in
the A site becoming vacant, allowing a new aminoacyl-tRNA to enter. The
elongation cycle is now repeated, and continues until the end of the open
reading frame is reached.

Peptidyl transferase is a ribozyme
A ribosome-associated protein that has the peptidyl transferase activity
needed to synthesize peptide bonds during translation has never been isolated. The reason for this lack of success is now known, at least for bacteria:
the enzyme activity is specified by part of the 23S rRNA and hence is another
example of a ribozyme (Section 12.2.4).
When the base-paired structures of rRNAs (see Figure 13.11) were first determined in the early 1980s, the possibility that an RNA molecule could have
enzymatic activity was unheard of, the breakthrough discoveries with regard
to ribozymes not being made until the period 1982–86. Ribosomal RNAs were
therefore initially assigned purely structural roles in the ribosome, their basepaired conformations being looked upon as scaffolds to which the important
components of the ribosome—the proteins—were attached. Problems with
this interpretation began to arise in the late 1980s when difficulties were
encountered in identifying the protein or proteins responsible for the central
catalytic activity of the ribosome—the formation of peptide bonds. By now the
existence of ribozymes had been established and molecular biologists began
to take seriously the possibility that rRNAs might have an enzymatic role in
protein synthesis. To test this hypothesis it was necessary to locate with precision the site of peptidyl transferase activity in the ribosome. Over the years,
antibiotics and other inhibitors of protein synthesis have played an important

Genomes Chapter 13

27/3/06

12:43 pm

Page 403

The Role of the Ribosome in Protein Synthesis

role in studies of ribosome function. In 1995, a new inhibitor called CCdAphosphate-puromycin was synthesized, this compound being an analog of
the intermediate structure formed when two amino acids are joined by formation of a peptide bond during protein synthesis. CCdA-phosphate-puromycin
binds tightly to the bacterial ribosome and, because of its structure, this binding site must be at precisely the position where peptide bonds are formed in
the functioning ribosome. X-ray crystallography was therefore used to reveal
exactly where CCdA-phosphate-puromycin binds within the large subunit. Its
position is deep down within the body of the subunit, closely associated with
the 23S rRNA of the large subunit, but 1.84 nm away from the nearest protein,
L3, and slightly more distant from L2, L4, and L10 (Figure 13.20). In atomic
terms, 1–2 nm is a massive distance, making it inconceivable that peptide
bond synthesis could be catalyzed by any one of these four proteins. The positioning of CCdA-phosphate-puromycin therefore provides convincing evidence that peptidyl transferase is a ribozyme.
Now that this evidence has been obtained, researchers are moving on to
determine exactly how the rRNA backbone acts as a ribozyme in peptide
bond formation. Attention was initially concentrated on an adenine
nucleotide at position 2451 in the E. coli 23S rRNA, because this adenine has
unusual charge properties compared with other nucleotides. The hypothesis
was that an interaction between this adenine and a nearby guanine, at position 2447, is the key to protein synthesis. But this model has been questioned
by mutational studies, which have shown that although replacing A2451 with
a uracil reduces the rate of peptide bond synthesis by 99%, both A2451 and
G2447 can be replaced by other nucleotides without detectable effect.
Attention is therefore turning to the other parts of the 23S rRNA that are
located in the vicinity of the active site.

Frameshifting and other unusual events during elongation
The straightforward codon-by-codon translation of an mRNA is looked upon
as the standard way in which proteins are synthesized. But an increasing
number of unusual elongation events are being discovered. One of these is
frameshifting, which occurs when a ribosome pauses in the middle of an
mRNA, moves back one nucleotide or, less frequently, forward one nucleotide,
and then continues translation. The result is that the codons that are read
after the pause are not contiguous with the preceding set of codons: they lie
in a different reading frame (Figure 13.21A).
Spontaneous frameshifts occur randomly and are deleterious because the
polypeptide synthesized after the frameshift has the incorrect amino acid
sequence. But not all frameshifts are spontaneous: a few mRNAs utilize programmed frameshifting to induce the ribosome to change frame at a specific
point within the transcript. Programmed frameshifting occurs in all types of
organism, from bacteria through to humans, as well as during expression of a
number of viral genomes. An example occurs during synthesis of DNA polymerase III in E. coli, the main enzyme involved in replication of DNA (Section
15.2.2). Two of the DNA polymerase III subunits, g and t, are coded by a single gene, dnaX. Subunit t is the full-length translation product of the dnaX
mRNA, and subunit g is a shortened version. Synthesis of g involves a
frameshift in the middle of the dnaX mRNA, the ribosome encountering a
termination codon immediately after the frameshift and so producing the

truncated g version of the translation product. It is thought that the frameshift
is induced by three features of the dnaX mRNA:
G

A hairpin loop, located immediately after the frameshift position, which
stalls the ribosome.

G

A sequence similar to a ribosome binding site immediately upstream of
the frameshift position, which is thought to base-pair with the 16S rRNA
(as does an authentic ribosome binding site), again causing the ribosome
to stall.

G

The codon 5¢–AAG–3¢ at the frameshift position. The presence of a modified nucleotide at the wobble position of the tRNALys that decodes
5¢–AAG–3¢ means that the codon–anticodon interaction is relatively weak
at this position, enabling the frameshift to occur.

A similar phenomenon—translational slippage—enables a single ribosome
to translate an mRNA that contains copies of two or more genes (Figure
13.21B). This means that, for example, a single ribosome can synthesize each
of the five proteins coded by the mRNA transcribed from the tryptophan
operon of E. coli (see Figure 8.8B). When the ribosome reaches the end of one
series of codons, it releases the protein it has just made, slips to the next initiation codon, and begins synthesizing the next protein. A more extreme
form of slippage is translational bypassing, in which a larger part of the transcript, possibly a few tens of base pairs, is skipped, and elongation of the original protein continues after the bypassing event (Figure 13.21C). The bypass
starts and ends either at two identical codons or at two codons that can be

Genomes Chapter 13

translated by the same tRNA by wobble. This suggests that the jump is controlled by the tRNA attached to the growing polypeptide, which scans the
mRNA as the ribosome tracks along, and halts the bypass when a new codon
to which it can base-pair is reached. Translational bypassing of 44
nucleotides occurs in E. coli during translation of the mRNA for gene 60 of T4
bacteriophage, which codes for a DNA topoisomerase subunit. Similar events
have also been identified in a variety of other bacteria. Bypassing could result
in two different proteins being synthesized from one mRNA—one protein
from normal translation and one from bypassing—but whether this is its
general function is not yet known.

13.2.4 Termination of translation
Protein synthesis ends when one of the three termination codons is reached
(Figure 13.22). The A site is now entered not by a tRNA but by a protein
release factor (Table 13.5). Bacteria have three of these: RF-1, which recognizes the termination codons 5¢–UAA–3¢ and 5¢–UAG–3¢; RF-2, which recognizes the termination codons 5¢–UAA–3¢ and 5¢–UGA–3¢; and RF-3, which
stimulates release of RF-1 and RF-2 from the ribosome after termination, in a
reaction requiring energy from the hydrolysis of GTP. Eukaryotes have just
two release factors: eRF-1, which recognizes all three termination codons,
and eRF-3, which might play the same role as RF-3 although this has not been
proven. The structure of eRF-1 has been solved by X-ray crystallography,
showing that the shape of this protein is very similar to that of a tRNA (Figure
13.23). This leads to a model in which a release factor mimics the structure of
a tRNA and hence is able to enter the A site when the termination codon is
reached. This model is attractive, but other studies suggest that the release
factor adopts a different conformation when associated with a ribosome, one
that is less similar to the shape of a tRNA.
The release factors terminate translation but they do not appear to be responsible for disassociation of the ribosomal subunits, at least not in bacteria. This
is the function of an additional protein called ribosome recycling factor
(RRF) which, like eRF-1, has a tRNA-like structure. RRF probably enters the P
or A site and “unlocks” the ribosome (see Figure 13.22). Disassociation
requires energy, which is released from GTP by EF-2, one of the elongation
factors, and also requires the initiation factor IF-3 to prevent the subunits
from attaching together again. A eukaryotic equivalent of RRF has not been
identified, and this may be one of the functions of eRF-3. The disassociated
ribosome subunits enter the cytoplasmic pool, where they remain until used
again in another round of translation.

13.2.5 Translation in the archaea
The descriptions above refer to the events occurring during translation in
bacteria and eukaryotes. We should not ignore the second group of prokaryotes, the archaea, and so before moving on we will briefly review what is know
about translation in these organisms.
In most respects, translation in the archaea more closely resembles the
equivalent events in the eukaryotes rather than in bacteria. The one apparent exception is that the archaeal ribosome, with a sedimentation coefficient of 70S, is comparable in size to the bacterial ribosome and, like bacterial ribosomes, contains 23S, 16S, and 5S rRNAs. This apparent similarity is
illusory because the archaeal rRNAs form base-paired secondary structures

that are significantly different from the equivalent bacterial structures. The
archaeal rRNA structures are also different from the eukaryotic versions,
but the ribosomal proteins that attach to the rRNAs are homologs of the
eukaryotic proteins.
Archaeal mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated, and translation initiation
is thought to involve a scanning process similar to that described for eukaryotic mRNAs. Archaeal tRNAs display a few unique features, including the
absence of thymidine in the so-called TYC arm of the cloverleaf, and the
presence at various positions of modified nucleotides not seen in either bacteria or eukaryotes. The methionine carried by the initiator tRNA is not
N-formylated and the initiation and elongation factors resemble the eukaryotic molecules.

that emerges from the ribosome is inactive, and before taking on its functional

role in the cell must undergo at least the first of the following four types of
posttranslational processing (Figure 13.24):
G

Protein folding. The polypeptide is inactive until it is folded into its correct tertiary structure.

G

Proteolytic cleavage. Some proteins are processed by cutting events carried out by enzymes called proteases. These cutting events may remove
segments from one or both ends of the polypeptide, resulting in a shortened form of the protein, or they may cut the polypeptide into a number
of different segments, all or some of which are active.

G

Chemical modification. Individual amino acids in the polypeptide might
be modified by attachment of new chemical groups.

G

Intein splicing. Inteins are intervening sequences in some proteins, similar in a way to introns in mRNAs. They have to be removed and the
exteins ligated in order for the protein to become active.

Often these different types of processing occur together, the polypeptide
being cut and modified at the same time that it is folded. If this is the case
then the cutting, modification, and/or splicing events may be necessary for
the polypeptide to take up its correct three-dimensional conformation,
because this is dependent in part on the relative positioning of the various
chemical groups along the molecule. Alternatively, a cutting event or a chemical modification may occur after the protein has been folded, possibly as
part of a regulatory mechanism that converts a folded but inactive protein
into an active form.

13.3.1 Protein folding
Recall that in Section 1.3.1 we examined the four levels of protein structure (primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary) and learnt that all of the information
that a polypeptide needs in order to fold into its correct three-dimensional
structure is contained within its amino acid sequence. This is one of the central
principles of molecular biology. We must therefore examine its experimental
basis and consider how the information contained in the amino acid sequence
is utilized during the folding process for a newly translated polypeptide.

Not all proteins fold spontaneously in the test tube
The notion that the amino acid sequence contains all the information needed
to fold the polypeptide into its correct tertiary structure derives from experiments carried out with ribonuclease in the 1960s. Ribonuclease is a small protein, just 124 amino acids in length, containing four disulfide bridges and with

a tertiary structure that is made up predominantly of b-sheet, with very little
a-helix. Studies of its folding were carried out with ribonuclease that had been
purified from cow pancreas and resuspended in buffer. Addition of urea, a
compound that disrupts hydrogen bonding, resulted in a decrease in the
activity of the enzyme (measured by testing its ability to cut RNA) and an
increase in the viscosity of the solution (Figure 13.25), indicating that the protein was being denatured by unfolding into an unstructured polypeptide
chain. The critical observation was that when the urea was removed by dialysis, the viscosity decreased and the enzyme activity reappeared. The conclusion is that the protein refolds spontaneously when the denaturant (in this
case, urea) is removed. In these initial experiments, the four disulfide bonds
remained intact because they were not disrupted by urea, but the same result
occurred when the urea treatment was combined with addition of a reducing
agent to break the disulfide bonds: the activity was still regained on renaturation. This shows that the disulfide bonds are not critical to the protein’s ability
to refold, they merely stabilize the tertiary structure once it has been adopted.
More detailed study of the spontaneous folding pathways for ribonuclease
and other small proteins has led to the following general two-step description
of the process:
G

The secondary structural motifs along the polypeptide chain form within
a few milliseconds of the denaturant being removed. This step is accompanied by the protein collapsing into a compact, but not folded, organization, with its hydrophobic groups on the inside, shielded from water.

G

During the next few seconds or minutes, the secondary structural motifs
interact with one another and the tertiary structure gradually takes shape,
often via a series of intermediate conformations. In other words, the protein follows a folding pathway. There may, however, be more than one
possible pathway that a protein can follow to reach its correctly folded
structure. The pathways may also have side-branches into which the protein can be diverted, leading to an incorrect structure. If an incorrect
structure is sufficiently unstable then partial or complete unfolding may
occur, allowing the protein a second opportunity to pursue a productive
route towards its correct conformation (Figure 13.26).

protein might be able to refold into its

represents the correct folding pathway,
leading from the unfolded protein on the
left to the active protein on the right. The
red arrow leads to an incorrectly folded
conformation, but this conformation is
unstable and the protein is able to unfold
partially, return to its correct folding pathway
and, eventually, reach its active
conformation.

For several years it was more or less assumed that all proteins would fold
spontaneously in the test tube, but experiments have shown that only smaller
proteins with less complex structures possess this ability. Two factors seem to
prevent larger proteins from folding spontaneously. The first of these is their
tendency to form insoluble aggregates when the denaturant is removed: the
polypeptides may collapse into interlocked networks when they attempt to
protect their hydrophobic groups from water in step one of the general folding pathway. Experimentally, this can be avoided by using a low dilution of the
protein, but this is not an option that the cell can take to prevent its unfolded
proteins from aggregating. The second factor that prevents folding is that a
large protein tends to get stuck in nonproductive side-branches of its folding
pathway, taking on an intermediate form that is incorrectly folded but which
is too stable to unfold to any significant extent. Concerns have also been
raised about the relevance of in vitro folding, as studied with ribonuclease, to
the folding of proteins in the cell, because a cellular protein might begin to
fold before it has been fully synthesized. If the initial folding occurs when only
part of the polypeptide is available, then there might be an increased possibility of incorrect branches of the folding pathway being followed. These various
considerations prompted research into protein folding in living cells.

In cells, folding is aided by molecular chaperones
Most of our current understanding of protein folding in the cell is founded on
the discovery of proteins that help other proteins to fold. These are called
molecular chaperones and have been studied in most detail in E. coli. It is
clear that both eukaryotes and archaea possess equivalent proteins, although
some of the details of the way they work are different.
The molecular chaperones can be divided into two groups:
G

The Hsp70 chaperones, which include the proteins called Hsp70 (coded
by the dnaK gene in E. coli and sometimes called DnaK protein), Hsp40
(coded by dnaJ), and GrpE.

G

The chaperonins, the main version of which is the GroEL/GroES complex
present in bacteria and eukaryotes, and TRiC found only in eukaryotes.

Molecular chaperones do not specify the tertiary structure of a protein, they
merely help the protein find that correct structure. The two types of chaperone do this in different ways. The Hsp70 family bind to hydrophobic regions
of unfolded proteins, including proteins that are still being translated (Figure
13.27). They hold the protein in an open conformation and aid folding, presumably by modulating the association between those parts of the polypeptide which form interactions in the folded protein. Exactly how this is
achieved is not understood but it involves repeated binding and detachment
of the Hsp70 protein, each cycle of which requires energy provided by the
hydrolysis of ATP. The Hsp70 protein, as well as binding to the target polypeptide, has an ATPase activity and hence can release this energy, but it can function efficiently only with the help of Hsp40 and GrpE. Hsp40 stimulates the
ATPase activity of Hsp70, and GrpE removes from the complex the ADP molecule (into which ATP is converted after energy release) enabling the cycle to
begin again. As well as protein folding, the Hsp70 chaperones are also
involved in other processes that require shielding of hydrophobic regions in
proteins, such as transport through membranes, association of proteins into
multisubunit complexes, and disaggregation of proteins that have been damaged by heat stress.

The chaperonins work in a quite different way. GroEL and GroES form a multisubunit structure that looks like a hollowed-out bullet with a central cavity
(Figure 13.28). A single, unfolded protein enters the cavity and emerges
folded. The mechanism for this is not known but it is postulated that the
GroEL/GroES complex acts as a cage that prevents the unfolded protein from
aggregating with other proteins, and that the inside surface of the cavity
changes from hydrophobic to hydrophilic in such a way as to promote the
burial of hydrophobic amino acids within the protein. This is not the only
hypothesis: other researchers hold that the cavity unfolds proteins that have
folded incorrectly, passing these unfolded proteins back to the cytoplasm so
they can have a second attempt at adopting their correct tertiary structure.
Although both the Hsp70 family of chaperones and the GroEL/GroES chaperonins are present in eukaryotes, it seems that in these organisms protein folding depends mainly on the action of the Hsp70 proteins. This is probably true
also of bacteria, even though the GroEL/GroES chaperonins play a major role
in the folding of metabolic enzymes and proteins involved in transcription
and translation.

It is used to cut polyproteins into segments, all or some of which are
active proteins.

These events are relatively common in eukaryotes but less frequent in bacteria.

also occurs with some proteins. On the
right, a polyprotein is processed to give
three different proteins. Not all proteins
undergo proteolytic cleavage.

Cleavage of the ends of polypeptides
Processing by cleavage is common with secreted polypeptides whose biochemical activities might be deleterious to the cell producing the protein. An
example is provided by melittin, the most abundant protein in bee venom and
the one responsible for causing cell lysis after injection of the bee sting into the
person or animal being stung. Melittin lyses cells in bees as well as animals
and so must initially be synthesized as an inactive precursor. This precursor,
promelittin, has 22 additional amino acids at its N terminus. The presequence
is removed by an extracellular protease that cuts it at 11 positions, releasing

the active venom protein. The protease does not cleave within the active
sequence because its mode of action is to release dipeptides with the sequence
X–Y, where X is alanine, aspartic acid, or glutamic acid, and Y is alanine or proline; these motifs do not occur in the active sequence (Figure 13.30).
A similar type of processing occurs with insulin, the protein made in the islets
of Langerhans in the vertebrate pancreas and responsible for controlling
blood sugar levels. Insulin is synthesized as preproinsulin, which is 105
amino acids in length (Figure 13.31). The processing pathway involves the
removal of the first 24 amino acids to give proinsulin, followed by two additional cuts which excise a central segment, leaving two active parts of the protein, the A and B chains, which link together by formation of two disulfide
bonds to form mature insulin. The first segment to be removed, the 24 amino
acids from the N terminus, is a signal peptide, a highly hydrophobic stretch
of amino acids that attaches the precursor protein to a membrane prior to
transport across that membrane and out of the cell. Signal peptides are commonly found on proteins that bind to and/or cross membranes, in both
eukaryotes and prokaryotes.

Proteolytic processing of polyproteins
In the examples shown in Figures 13.30 and 13.31, proteolytic processing
results in a single mature protein. This is not always the case. Some proteins

are initially synthesized as polyproteins, long polypeptides that contain a
series of mature proteins linked together in head-to-tail fashion. Cleavage of
the polyprotein releases the individual proteins, which may have very different functions from one another.
Polyproteins are not uncommon in eukaryotes. Several types of virus that
infect eukaryotic cells use them as a way of reducing the sizes of their
genomes, a single polyprotein gene with one promoter and one terminator
taking up less space than a series of individual genes. Polyproteins are also
involved in the synthesis of peptide hormones in vertebrates. For example,
the polyprotein called pro-opiomelanocortin, made in the pituitary gland,
contains at least ten different peptide hormones. These are released by proteolytic cleavage of the polyprotein (Figure 13.32), but not all can be produced
at once because of overlaps between individual peptide sequences. Instead,
the exact cleavage pattern is different in different cells.

13.3.3 Processing by chemical modification
Genomes have the capacity to code for 22 different amino acids: the 20 specified by the standard genetic code, selenocysteine, and (at least in archaea)
pyrrolysine, the latter two being inserted into polypeptides by contextdependent reassignment of 5¢–UGA–3¢ and 5¢–UAG–3¢, respectively (Section
1.3.2). This repertoire is increased dramatically by posttranslational chemical
modification of proteins, which results in a vast array of different amino acid
types. The simpler types of modification occur in all organisms; the more
complex ones, especially glycosylation, are rare in bacteria.
The simplest types of chemical modification involve addition of a small
chemical group (e.g., an acetyl, methyl, or phosphate group; Table 13.6) to an
amino acid side chain, or to the amino or carboxyl groups of the terminal
amino acids in a polypeptide. Over 150 different modified amino acids have

been documented in different proteins, with each modification carried out in
a highly specific manner, the same amino acids being modified in the same
way in every copy of the protein. This is illustrated in Figure 13.33 for histone
H3. The example reminds us that chemical modification often plays a central
role in determining the precise biochemical activity of the target protein: we
saw in Section 10.2.1 how acetylation, methylation, and phosphorylation of
H3 and other histones have an important influence on chromatin structure
and hence on genome expression. Chemical modification has several other
regulatory roles, phosphorylation in particular being used to activate many
proteins involved in signal transduction (Section 14.1.2).

this region are shown. Abbreviations:

(A) O-linked glycosylation

Sia
Gal

O

A more complex type of modification is glycosylation, the attachment of
large, carbohydrate side chains to polypeptides. There are two general types
of glycosylation (Figure 13.34):
G

O-linked glycosylation is the attachment of a sugar side chain via the
hydroxyl group of a serine or threonine amino acid.

G

N-linked glycosylation involves attachment of a sugar side chain through
the amino group on the side chain of asparagine.

Glycosylation can result in attachment to the protein of grand structures
comprising branched networks of 10–20 sugar units of various types. These
side chains help to target proteins to particular sites in cells and determine
the stability of proteins circulating in the bloodstream. Another type of largescale modification involves attachment of long-chain lipids, often to serine or
cysteine amino acids. This process is called acylation and occurs with many
proteins that become associated with membranes. A less common modification is biotinylation, in which a molecule of biotin is attached to a small
number of enzymes that catalyze the carboxylation of organic acids such as
acetate and propionate.

13.3.4 Inteins
The final type of posttranslational processing that we must consider is intein
splicing, a protein version of the more extensive intron splicing that occurs
with pre-RNAs. Inteins are internal segments of proteins that are removed
soon after translation, the two external segments, or exteins, becoming linked
together (Figure 13.35). The first intein was discovered in S. cerevisiae in 1990,
and there have been only 100 confirmed identifications so far. Despite their
scarcity, inteins are widespread across different organisms. Most are known
in bacteria and archaea but there are also examples in lower eukaryotes. In a
few cases there is more than one intein in a single protein.
Most inteins are approximately 150 amino acids in length and, like pre-mRNA
introns (Section 12.2.2), the sequences at the splice junctions of inteins have
some similarity in most of the known examples. In particular, the first amino
acid of the downstream extein is cysteine, serine, or threonine. A few other
amino acids within the intein sequence are also conserved. These conserved
amino acids are involved in the splicing process, which is self-catalyzed by
the intein itself.

Two interesting features of inteins have recently come to light. The first of
these was discovered when the structures of two inteins were determined by
X-ray crystallography. These structures are similar in some respects to that of
a Drosophila protein called Hedgehog, which is involved in development of
the segmentation pattern of the fly embryo. Hedgehog is an autoprocessing
protein that cuts itself in two. The structural similarity with inteins lies in the
part of the Hedgehog protein that catalyzes its self-cleavage. Possibly the
same protein structure has evolved twice, or possibly inteins and Hedgehog
shared a common link at some stage in the evolutionary past.
The second interesting feature is that with some inteins the excised segment
is a sequence-specific endonuclease. The intein cuts DNA at the sequence
corresponding to its insertion site in a gene coding for an intein-free version
of the protein from which it is derived (Figure 13.36). If the cell also contains
a gene coding for the intein-containing protein, then the DNA sequence for
the intein is able to jump into the cut site, converting the intein-minus gene
into an intein-plus version, a process called intein homing. The same type of
event occurs with some Group I introns (Section 12.2.4), which code for proteins that direct intron homing. It is possible that transfer of inteins and
Group I introns might also occur between cells or even between species. This
is thought to be a mechanism by which selfish DNA is able to propagate
(Section 18.3).

13.4 Protein Degradation
The protein synthesis and processing events that we have studied so far in
this chapter result in new, active proteins that take up their place in the cell’s
proteome. These proteins either replace existing ones that have reached the
end of their working lives or provide new protein functions in response to the
changing requirements of the cell. The concept that the proteome of a cell
can change over time requires not only de novo protein synthesis but also the
removal of proteins whose functions are no longer required. This removal
must be highly selective so that only the correct proteins are degraded, and

must also be rapid in order to account for the abrupt changes that occur
under certain conditions, for example during key transitions in the cell cycle.
For many years, protein degradation was an unfashionable subject and it was
not until the 1990s that real progress was made in understanding how specific
proteolysis events are linked with processes such as the cell cycle and differentiation. Even now, our knowledge centers largely on descriptions of general
protein breakdown pathways and less on the regulation of the pathways and
the mechanisms used to target specific proteins. There appear to be a number of different types of breakdown pathway whose interconnectivities have
not yet been traced. This is particularly true in bacteria, which seem to have
a range of proteases that work together in controlled degradation of proteins.
In eukaryotes, most breakdown involves a single system, involving ubiquitin
and the proteasome.
A link between ubiquitin and protein degradation was first established in
1975 when it was shown that this abundant 76-amino-acid protein is involved
in energy-dependent proteolysis reactions in rabbit cells. Subsequent
research identified a series of three enzymes that attach ubiquitin molecules,
singly or in chains, to lysine amino acids in proteins that are targeted for
breakdown. There are also ubiquitin-like proteins, such as SUMO, which act
in the same way as ubiquitin. Whether or not a protein becomes ubiquitinated depends on the presence or absence within it of amino acid motifs that
act as degradation-susceptibility signals. These signals have not been completely characterized but there are thought to be at least ten different types in
S. cerevisiae, including:
G

The N-degron, a sequence element present at the N terminus of a protein.

G

PEST sequences, internal sequences that are rich in proline (P), glutamic
acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T).

These sequences are permanent features of the proteins that contain them
and so cannot be straightforward “degradation signals”: if they were then
these proteins would be broken down as soon as they are synthesized.
Instead, they must determine susceptibility to degradation and hence the
general stability of a protein in the cell. How this might be linked to the controlled breakdown of selected proteins at specific times, for instance during
the cell cycle, is not yet clear.
The second component of the ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway is
the proteasome, the structure within which ubiquitinated proteins are broken down. In eukaryotes, the proteasome is a large, multisubunit structure
with a sedimentation coefficient of 26S, comprising a hollow cylinder of 20S
and two “caps” of 19S (Figure 13.37). Archaea also have proteasomes of about
the same size but these are less complex, being composed of multiple copies
of just two proteins: eukaryotic proteasomes contain 14 different types of
protein subunit. The entrance into the cavity within the proteasome is narrow, and a protein must be unfolded before it can enter. This unfolding probably occurs through an energy-dependent process and may involve structures similar to chaperonins (Section 13.3.1) but with unfolding rather than
folding activity. After unfolding, the protein can enter the proteasome within
which it is cleaved into short peptides 4–10 amino acids in length. These are
released back into the cytoplasm where they are broken down into individual
amino acids which can be reutilized in protein synthesis.

Chapter 13 Synthesis and Processing of the Proteome

Summary
The end result of genome expression is the proteome, the collection of functioning proteins synthesized by a living cell. The identity and relative abundance of the individual proteins in a proteome represents a balance between
the synthesis of new proteins and the degradation of existing ones. Transfer
RNAs play the central role in protein synthesis by acting as adaptor molecules
which form the physical and informational link between the mRNA being
translated and the polypeptide being synthesized. Virtually all tRNAs fold into
the same base-paired structure, whose two-dimensional representation is
called the cloverleaf. The correct amino acid is attached to the 3¢ end of a
tRNA by an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. Aminoacylation is very accurate
because each aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase has a high fidelity for its tRNA and
amino acid, and because there is also a proofreading mechanism which
checks that the correct amino acid has been attached to the correct tRNA.
Codon–anticodon interactions ensure that the rules of the genetic code are
obeyed. Although the code has 61 triplets that specify amino acids, most cells
have fewer than this number of tRNAs, because a single tRNA can read two or
more codons by the process called wobble. The structure of the ribosome is
being probed in ever-increasing detail by various techniques including X-ray
crystallography. Initiation of translation in bacteria involves the small subunit of the ribosome recognizing an internal binding site on the mRNA, a few
nucleotides upstream of the initiation codon. In eukaryotes only a few
mRNAs have internal binding sites, the more common process involving
attachment of the small subunit of the ribosome to the capped 5¢ end of the
mRNA, followed by scanning along the mRNA to find the initiation codon.
Various mechanisms by which initiation of translation can be regulated,
either globally or at specific transcripts, are known. Addition of the large subunit of the ribosome to the initiation complex enables the elongation phase
of translation to commence. The central activity during elongation is synthesis of peptide bonds. Peptide bond formation is catalyzed by peptidyl transferase, an enzyme activity that resides within one of the rRNA molecules,
which acts as a ribozyme. Unusual elongation events include programmed
changes of reading frame and translational bypassing, the latter resulting in a
substantial segment of the mRNA being skipped by the ribosome.
Termination of translation involves special proteins which enter the ribosome when a termination codon is reached. The polypeptide that is initially
synthesized must be folded into its correct tertiary structure and possibly
processed by proteolytic cleavage and/or chemical modification. A very small
number of proteins contain intervening sequences called inteins which must
be removed by protein splicing. Protein degradation in eukaryotes involves
ubiquitination of proteins targeted for destruction followed by their degradation within a proteasome.

Changes in Genome Activity
14.3 Regulation of Genome Activity During
Development

When you have read Chapter 14, you should be able to:
Distinguish between differentiation and development, and outline how regulation of genome
expression underlies these two processes.
Describe, with examples, the various ways in which imported signaling compounds, such as
lactoferrin and steroid hormones, can bring about transient changes in genome activity.
Give a detailed account of catabolite repression in bacteria.
Discuss the various pathways by which signals from cell surface receptors are transmitted to the
genome.
Describe, with examples, the various ways in which permanent and semipermanent changes in
genome activity can be brought about, making clear distinction between those processes that
involve rearrangement of the genome, those that involve changes in chromatin structure, and
those that involve feedback loops.
Discuss how studies of the lysogenic infection cycle of bacteriophage l, and of sporulation in
Bacillus subtilis, provide basic information relevant to differentiation and development.
Explain why Caenorhabditis elegans is a useful model organism and describe how cell fate is
determined during development of the C. elegans vulva.
Describe the genetic events that underlie embryogenesis in Drosophila melanogaster.
Discuss the roles of homeotic genes in D. melanogaster, vertebrates, and plants.

We have followed the pathway by which expression of the genome specifies
the content of the proteome, which in turn determines the biochemical signature of the cell. In no organism is this biochemical signature entirely constant.
Even the simplest unicellular organisms are able to alter their proteomes to
take account of changes in the environment, so that their biochemical capabilities are continually in tune with the available nutrient supply and the prevailing physical and chemical conditions. Cells in multicellular organisms are

equally responsive to changes in the extracellular environment, the only difference being that the major stimuli include hormones and growth factors as
well as nutrients. The resulting transient changes in genome activity enable
the proteome to be remodeled continuously to satisfy the demands that the
outside world places on the cell (Figure 14.1). Other changes in genome activity are permanent or at least semipermanent, and result in the cell’s biochemical signature becoming altered in a way that is not readily reversible. These

Transient Changes in Genome Activity

changes lead to cellular differentiation, the adoption by the cell of a specialized physiological role. Differentiation pathways are known in many unicellular organisms, an example being the production of spore cells by bacteria
such as Bacillus, but we more frequently associate differentiation with multicellular organisms, in which a variety of specialized cell types (over 250 types
in humans) are organized into tissues and organs. Assembly of these complex
multicellular structures, and of the organism as a whole, requires coordination of the activities of the genomes in different cells. This coordination
involves both transient and permanent changes, and must continue over a
long period of time during the development of the organism.
There are many steps within the expression pathways for individual genes at
which regulation can be exerted (Table 14.1). Examples of the biological
roles of different regulatory mechanisms were given at the appropriate
places in Chapters 10–13. The objective of this chapter is not to reiterate
these gene-specific control systems, but to explain how the activity of the
genome as a whole is regulated. In doing this we should bear in mind that
the biosphere is so diverse, and the numbers of genes in individual genomes
so large, that it is reasonable to assume that any mechanism that could have
evolved to regulate genome expression is likely to have done so. It is therefore no surprise that we can nominate examples of regulation for every point
in the genome expression pathway. But are all these control points of equal
importance in regulating the activity of the genome as a whole? Our current
perception is that they are not. Our understanding may be imperfect, based
as it is on investigation of just a limited number of genes in a few organisms,
but it appears that the critical controls over genome expression—the decisions about which genes are switched on and which are switched off—are
exerted at the level of transcription initiation. For most genes, control that is
exerted at later steps serves to modulate expression but does not act as the
primary determinant of whether the gene is on or off (see Figure 11.22).
Most, but not all, of what we will discuss in this chapter therefore concerns
control of genome activity by mechanisms that specify which genes are transcribed and which are silent. We will address two issues: the ways in which
transient and permanent changes in genome activity are brought about, and
the ways in which these changes are linked in time and space in developmental pathways.

14.1 Transient Changes in Genome Activity
Transient changes in genome activity occur predominantly in response to
external stimuli. For unicellular organisms, the most important external stimuli relate to nutrient availability, these cells living in variable environments in
which the identities and relative amounts of the nutrients change over time.
The genomes of unicellular organisms therefore include genes for uptake and
utilization of a range of nutrients, and changes in nutrient availability are
shadowed by changes in genome activity, so that at any one time only those
genes needed to utilize the available nutrients are expressed. Most cells in
multicellular organisms live in less variable environments, but an environment whose maintenance requires coordination between the activities of different cells. For these cells, the major external stimuli are therefore hormones, growth factors, and related compounds that convey signals within the
organism and stimulate coordinated changes in genome activity.

Transient Changes in Genome Activity

To exert an effect on genome activity, the nutrient, hormone, growth factor, or
other extracellular compound that represents the external stimulus must
influence events within the cell. There are two ways in which it can do this
(Figure 14.2):
G

Directly, by acting as a signaling compound that is transported across the
cell membrane and into the cell.

G

Indirectly, by binding to a cell surface receptor which transmits a signal
into the cell.

Signal transmission, by direct or indirect means, is one of the major research
areas in cell biology, with attention focused in particular on its relevance to
the abnormal biochemical activities that underlie cancer. Many examples of
signal transmission have been discovered, some of general importance in a
variety of organisms and others restricted to just a few species. In the first part
of this chapter we will survey these signaling pathways.

Figure 14.2 Two ways in which an
extracellular signaling compound can
influence events occurring within a cell.

In the direct method of signal transmission, the extracellular compound that
represents the external stimulus crosses the cell membrane and enters the
cell. After import into the cell, the signaling compound could influence
genome activity by any one of three routes (Figure 14.3).
G

If the signaling compound is a protein, then it could act in the same way
as one of the various regulatory proteins that we met in Chapters 10–13,
for example by activating or repressing assembly of the transcription initiation complex (Section 11.3), or by interacting with a splicing enhancer
or silencer (Section 12.2.2).

G

The signaling compound could directly influence the activity of an existing regulatory protein. Such a signaling compound need not itself be a
protein: it could, theoretically, be any type of compound.

G

The signaling compound could influence the activity of an existing regulatory protein via one or more intermediates, rather than by interacting
with it directly.

Examples of each of these three modes of action are described below.

Chapter 14 Regulation of Genome Activity

Lactoferrin is an extracellular signaling protein which acts as a
transcription activator
If the extracellular signaling compound that is imported into the cell is a protein with suitable properties then it could directly affect the activity of its target genes by acting as an activator or repressor of some stage in the genome
expression pathway. This might appear to be an attractively straightforward
way of regulating genome activity, but it is not a common mechanism. The
reason for this is not clear but probably relates, at least partly, to the difficulty
in designing a protein that combines the hydrophobic properties needed for
effective transport across a membrane with the hydrophilic properties
needed for migration through the aqueous cytoplasm to the protein’s site of
action in the nucleus or on a ribosome.

Figure 14.4 Copper-regulated gene
expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Yeast requires low amounts of copper
because a few of its enzymes (e.g.,
cytochrome c oxidase and tyrosinase) are
copper-containing metalloproteins, but too
much copper is toxic for the cell. When
copper levels are low, the Mac1p protein
factor is activated by copper binding and
switches on expression of genes for copper
uptake. When the copper levels are too
high, a second factor, Ace1p, is activated,
switching on expression of a different set of
genes, these coding for proteins involved in
copper detoxification.

The one clear example of a signaling compound that can function in this way
is provided by lactoferrin, a mammalian protein found mainly in milk and, to
a lesser extent, in the bloodstream. Lactoferrin is a transcription activator
(Section 11.3.2). Its specific function has been difficult to pin down, but it
seems to play a role in the body’s defenses against microbial attack. As its name
suggests, lactoferrin is able to bind iron, and it is thought that at least part of its
protective role arises from its ability to reduce free-iron levels in milk, thereby
starving invading microbes of this essential cofactor. It might therefore appear
unlikely that lactoferrin would have a role in genome expression, but it has
been known since the early 1980s that the protein is multitalented and, among
other things, can bind to DNA. This property was linked to a second function
of lactoferrin—stimulation of the blood cells involved in the immune
response—when in 1992 it was shown that the protein is taken up by immune
cells, enters their nuclei, and attaches to the genome. Subsequently the DNA
binding was shown to be sequence specific and to result in transcription being
stimulated, confirming that lactoferrin is a true transcription activator.

Some imported signaling compounds directly influence the activity of
preexisting regulatory proteins
Although only a few imported signaling compounds are able themselves to
act as activators or repressors of genome expression, many have the ability to
influence directly the activity of regulatory proteins that are already present
in the cell. We encountered one example of this type of regulation in Section
11.3.1 when we studied the lactose operon of Escherichia coli. This operon
responds to extracellular levels of lactose, this compound acting as a signaling molecule which enters the cell and, after conversion to its isomer allolactose, influences the DNA-binding properties of the lactose repressor and
hence determines whether or not the lactose operon is transcribed (see
Figure 11.24). Many other bacterial operons coding for genes involved in
sugar utilization are controlled in this way.
Direct interaction between a signaling compound and a transcription activator or repressor is also a common means of regulating genome activity in
eukaryotes. A good example is provided by the control system that maintains
the intracellular metal-ion content at an appropriate level. Cells need metal
ions such as copper and zinc as cofactors in biochemical reactions, but these
metals are toxic if they accumulate in the cell above a certain level. Their
uptake therefore has to be carefully controlled so that the cell contains sufficient metal ions when the environment is lacking in metal compounds, but
does not overaccumulate metal ions when the environmental concentrations

Genomes Chapter 14

Transient Changes in Genome Activity

are high. The strategies used are illustrated by the copper-control system of
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This yeast has two copper-dependent transcription
activators, Mac1p and Ace1p. Both of these activators bind copper ions, the
binding inducing a conformational change that enables the factor to stimulate expression of its target genes (Figure 14.4). For Mac1p these target genes
code for copper-uptake proteins, whereas for Ace1p they are genes coding for
proteins such as superoxide dismutase that are involved in copper detoxification. The metal-controlled balance between the activities of Mac1p and Ace1p
ensures that the copper content of the cell remains within acceptable levels.
Transcription activators are also the targets for steroid hormones, which are
signaling compounds that coordinate a range of physiological activities in the
cells of higher eukaryotes. They include the sex hormones (estrogens for
female sex development, androgens for male sex development), and the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones. Steroids are hydrophobic and
so easily penetrate the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, each hormone
binds to a specific steroid receptor protein, which is usually located in the
cytoplasm. After binding, the activated receptor migrates into the nucleus,
where it attaches to a hormone response element upstream of a target gene.
Once bound, the receptor acts as a transcription activator. Response elements for each receptor are located upstream of 50–100 genes, often within
enhancers, so a single steroid hormone can induce a large-scale change in the
biochemical properties of the cell. All steroid receptors are structurally similar, not just with regard to their DNA-binding domains but also in other parts
of their protein structures (Figure 14.5). Recognition of these similarities has
led to the identification of a number of putative or orphan steroid receptors
whose hormonal partners and cellular functions are not yet known. The
structural similarities have also shown that a second set of receptor proteins,
the nuclear receptor superfamily, belongs to the same general class as
steroid receptors, although the hormones that they work with are not
steroids. As their name suggests, these receptors are located in the nucleus
rather than the cytoplasm. They include the receptors for vitamin D3, whose
roles include control of bone development, and thyroxine, which stimulates
the tadpole-to-frog metamorphosis.
Steroid and nuclear receptors are dimers, each subunit of which possesses
one of the special zinc fingers that are characteristic of this group of proteins
(see Figure 11.5). Each of these zinc fingers recognizes and binds to a 6 bp
sequence in its hormone response element. For most steroid receptors, the
pair of 6 bp sequences are arranged as a direct or inverted repeat separated
by a 0–4 bp spacer (Figure 14.6). The response elements for nuclear receptors
are similar except that the recognition sequences are almost always direct
repeats. The spacer serves simply to ensure that the distance between the
recognition sequences is appropriate for the orientation of the zinc fingers in
the receptor protein. This means that different receptor proteins can possess
the same pair of zinc fingers but recognize different response elements,

Chapter 14 Regulation of Genome Activity

described in the previous section. Signaling molecules can also influence
genome activity in an indirect manner via one or more intermediates. An
example is provided by the catabolite repression system of bacteria. This is
the means by which extracellular and intracellular glucose levels dictate
whether or not operons for utilization of other sugars are switched on when
those alternative sugars are present in the medium.
This phenomenon was discovered in 1941 by Jacques Monod, who showed
that if E. coli or Bacillus subtilis are provided with a mixture of sugars, then
one sugar will be metabolized first, the bacteria turning to the second sugar
only when the first has been used up. Monod used a French word to describe
this: diauxie. One combination of sugars that elicits a diauxic response is glucose plus lactose, glucose being used before the lactose (Figure 14.7A). When
the details of the lactose operon were worked out some 20 years later (Section
11.3.1), it became clear that the diauxie between glucose and lactose must
involve a mechanism whereby the presence of glucose can override the
inductive effect that lactose usually has on its operon. In the presence of lactose plus glucose, the lactose operon is switched off, even though some of the
lactose in the mixture is converted into allolactose which binds to the lactose
repressor, so that under normal circumstances the operon would be transcribed (Figure 14.7B).
The explanation for the diauxic response is that glucose acts as a signaling
compound that represses expression of the lactose operon, as well as other
sugar utilization operons, through an indirect influence on the catabolite
activator protein (also called the CRP activator). This protein binds to a
recognition sequence at various sites in the bacterial genome and activates
transcription initiation at downstream promoters, probably by interacting
with the a subunit of the RNA polymerase. Inherent in this activation is the
creation of a sharp, 90˚ bend in the double helix in the region of the binding
site when the catabolite activator protein is attached. Productive initiation of
transcription at these promoters is dependent on the presence of bound
catabolite activator protein: if the protein is absent then the genes controlled
by the promoter are not transcribed.
Glucose does not itself interact with the catabolite activator protein. Instead,
glucose controls the level in the cell of the modified nucleotide cyclic AMP
(cAMP; Figure 14.7C). It does this by inhibiting the activity of adenylate
cyclase, the enzyme that synthesizes cAMP from ATP. Inhibition is mediated
by a protein called IIAGlc, a component of a multiprotein complex that transports sugars into the bacterium. When glucose is being transported into the
cell, IIAGlc becomes dephosphorylated (i.e., additional phosphate groups previously added to the protein by posttranslational modification are removed).
The dephosphorylated version of IIAGlc inhibits adenylate cyclase activity.
This means that if glucose levels are high, the cAMP content of the cell is low.
The catabolite activator protein can bind to its target sites only in the presence
of cAMP, so when glucose is present the protein remains detached and the
operons it controls are switched off. In the specific case of diauxie involving
glucose plus lactose, the indirect effect of glucose on the catabolite activator

Escherichia coli is grown in a medium containing a mixture of glucose and lactose. During
the first few hours, the bacteria divide exponentially, using the glucose as the carbon and
energy source. When the glucose is used up, there is a brief lag period while the lac genes
are switched on before the bacteria return to exponential growth, now using up the lactose.
(B) Glucose overrides the lactose repressor. If lactose is present, then the repressor detaches
from the operator and the lactose operon should be transcribed, but it remains silent if
glucose is also present. Refer to Figure 11.24B for details of how the lactose repressor
controls expression of the lactose operon. (C) Glucose exerts its effect on the lactose operon
and other target genes via IIAGlc, which controls the activity of adenylate cyclase and hence
regulates the amount of cAMP in the cell. The catabolite activator protein (CAP) can attach to
its DNA binding site only in the presence of cAMP. If glucose is present, the cAMP level is
low, so CAP does not bind to the DNA and does not activate the RNA polymerase. Once the
glucose has been used up, the cAMP level rises, allowing CAP to bind to the DNA and
activate transcription of the lactose operon and its other target genes.

protein means that the lactose operon remains inactivated, even though the
lactose repressor is not bound, and so the glucose in the medium is used up
first. When the glucose is gone, the cAMP level rises and the catabolite activator protein binds to its target sites, including the site upstream of the lactose
operon, and transcription of the lactose genes is activated.
Protein IIAGlc also has a second role in the diauxic response, one not involving the genome but which we should note for the sake of completeness. The
dephosphorylated form of IIAGlc prevents the uptake of lactose and other
sugars by inhibiting the permease enzymes that transport these sugars into
the cell—recall that the lactose permease is coded by lacY, the second gene in
the lactose operon (see Figure 8.8A). The presence of glucose therefore has a
dual effect: the operons for utilization of other sugars are switched off, and
the uptake of those sugars is prevented.

14.1.2 Signal transmission mediated by cell surface receptors
Many extracellular signaling compounds are unable to enter the cell because
they are too hydrophilic to penetrate the lipid membrane and the cell lacks a
specific transport mechanism for their uptake. In order to influence genome
activity these signaling compounds must bind to cell surface receptors that
carry their signals across the cell membrane. These receptors are proteins that
span the membrane, with a site for binding the signaling compound on the
outer surface. Binding of the signaling compound results in a conformational
change in the receptor. Often this conformation change is dimerization, the
liquid nature of the cell membrane permitting a limited amount of lateral
movement by membrane proteins, enabling the subunits of dimers to associate and disassociate in response to the presence or absence of the extracellular signal (Figure 14.8). The conformation change induces a biochemical
event within the cell. For example, the intracellular segments of many receptor proteins have kinase activity, so when the subunits are brought together in
a dimer they phosphorylate each other. This biochemical event, whether

mutual phosphorylation or some other reaction, forms the first step in the
intracellular stage of the signal transduction pathway.
Several types of cell surface receptor have been discovered (Table 14.2) and
the intracellular events that they initiate are diverse, with many variations on
each theme, not all of these specifically involved in regulating genome activity. Three examples will help us to appreciate the complexity of the system.

(A) Direct activation of a STAT

P

STAT

Signal transduction with one step between receptor and genome
With some signal transduction systems, stimulation of the cell surface receptor by attachment of the extracellular signaling compound results in the
direct activation of a protein that influences genome activity. This is the simplest system by which an extracellular signal can be transduced into a
genomic response.
The direct system is used by many cytokines such as interleukins and interferons, which are extracellular signaling polypeptides that control cell growth
and division. Binding of these polypeptides to their cell surface receptors
results in activation of a type of transcription factor called a STAT (signal
transducer and activator of transcription). Activation is by phosphorylation of
a single tyrosine amino acid at a position near to the C terminus of the STAT
polypeptide. If the cell surface receptor is a member of the tyrosine kinase
family (see Table 14.2) then it is able to activate the STAT directly (Figure
14.9A). If it is a tyrosine-kinase-associated receptor then it does not itself have
the ability to phosphorylate a STAT, or any other intracellular protein, but acts
through intermediaries called Janus kinases (JAKs). Binding of the signaling
molecule to a tyrosine-kinase-associated receptor causes a change in the conformation of the receptor, often by inducing dimerization. This causes a JAK
that is associated with the receptor to phosphorylate itself, this autoactivation
being followed by phosphorylation of the STAT by the JAK (Figure 14.9B).
Seven STATs have so far been identified in mammals. Three of these—STATs
2, 4, and 6—are specific for just one or two extracellular cytokines, but the
others are broad spectrum and can be activated by several different interleukins and interferons. Discrimination is provided by the cell surface receptors: a particular receptor binds just one type of cytokine, and most cells have
only one or a few types of cytokine receptor. Different cells therefore respond
in different ways to the presence of particular cytokines, even though the
internal signaling process involves only a limited number of STATs.
The consensus sequence of the DNA binding sites for STATs has been defined
as 5¢–TTN5–6AA–3¢, largely by studies in which purified STATs have been
tested against oligonucleotides of known sequence. The DNA-binding
domain of the STAT protein is made up of three loops emerging from a barrel-shaped b-sheet structure. This is an unusual type of DNA-binding domain
and has not been identified in precisely the same form in any other type of
protein, although it has similarities with the DNA-binding domains of the
NK-kB and Rel transcription activators. These similarities refer only to the
tertiary structures of the DNA-binding domains because STATs, NK-kB, and
Rel, as a whole, have very little amino acid sequence identity. Many target
genes are activated by STATs but the overall genomic response is modulated
by other proteins which interact with STATs and influence which genes are
switched on under a particular set of circumstances. Complexity is entirely

autophosphorylates when the extracellular
signal binds and then activates the STAT.
Note that activation of the JAK usually
involves dimerization, the extracellular signal
inducing two subunits to associate, resulting
in the version of the JAK with
phosphorylation activity. Dimerization is also
central to activation of a STAT,
phosphorylation causing two STATs, not
necessarily of the same type, to form a
dimer. This dimer is able to act as a
transcription activator. “P” indicates a
phosphate group, PO32–.

expected because the cellular processes that STATs mediate—growth and
division—are themselves complex, and we anticipate that changes in these
processes will require extensive remodeling of the proteome and hence largescale alterations in genome activity.

Signal transduction with many steps between receptor and genome
The simplicity of the system whereby the cell surface receptor activates a
STAT, directly or through a JAK associated with the receptor, contrasts with
the more prevalent forms of signal transduction, in which the receptor represents just the first in a series of steps that lead eventually to one or more transcription activators or repressors being switched on or off. A number of these
cascade pathways have been delineated in different organisms. The following
are the important ones in mammals:
G

The MAP (mitogen activated protein) kinase system (Figure 14.10)
responds to many extracellular signals, including mitogens—compounds
with similar effects to cytokines but that specifically stimulate cell division. Binding of the signaling compound results in dimerization of the
mitogen receptor and mutual phosphorylation of the internal parts of the
two subunits (see Figure 14.8). Phosphorylation stimulates attachment to
the receptor, on the internal side of the membrane, of various cytoplasmic
proteins, one of which is Raf, a protein kinase that is activated when it
becomes membrane bound. Raf initiates a cascade of phosphorylation
reactions. It phosphorylates Mek, activating this protein so that it, in turn,
phosphorylates the MAP kinase. The activated MAP kinase now moves
into the nucleus where it switches on, again by phosphorylation, a series
of transcription activators. The MAP kinase also phosphorylates another
protein kinase, this one called Rsk, which phosphorylates and activates a
second set of factors. Additional flexibility is provided by the possibility of
replacing one or more of the proteins in the MAP kinase pathway with
related proteins, ones with slightly different specificities, and so switching
on another suite of activators. The MAP kinase pathway is used by vertebrate cells; equivalent pathways, using intermediates similar to those
identified in mammals, are known in other organisms (see Sections 14.2.1
and 14.3.3 for examples).

G

The Ras system is centered around the Ras proteins, three of which are
known in mammalian cells (H-, K-, and N-Ras), and similar proteins such
as Rac and Rho. These proteins are involved in regulation of cell growth
and differentiation and, as with many proteins in this category, when dysfunctional they can give rise to cancer. The Ras family proteins are not
limited to mammals, examples being known in other eukaryotes such as
the fruit fly. Ras proteins are intermediates in signal transduction pathways that initiate with autophosphorylation of a tyrosine kinase receptor
in response to an extracellular signal. The phosphorylated version of the
receptor forms protein–protein complexes with GNRPs (guanine
nucleotide releasing proteins) and GAPs (GTPase activating proteins)
which activate and inactivate Ras, respectively (Figure 14.11). The extracellular signals can therefore switch Ras-mediated signal transduction on
or off, the choice between the two depending on the nature of the signal
and the relative amounts of active GNRPs and GAPs in the cell. When activated, Ras stimulates Raf activity, so in effect Ras provides a second entry
point into the MAP kinase pathway, although this is unlikely to be the only
function of Ras and it probably also activates proteins involved in signal
transduction by second messengers (as described in the next section).

The SAP (stress activated protein) kinase system is induced by stressrelated signals such as ultraviolet radiation, and growth factors associated
with inflammation. The pathway has not been described in detail but is
similar to the MAP kinase system although targeting a different set of transcription activators.

Each of the steps in these cascade pathways involves a physical interaction
between two proteins, often resulting in the “downstream” member of the
pair becoming phosphorylated. Phosphorylation activates the downstream
protein, enabling it to form a connection with the next protein in the cascade.
These interactions involve special protein–protein binding domains, such as
the ones called SH2 and SH3, which bind to receptor domains on their partner proteins. The receptor domains contain one or more tyrosines which
must be phosphorylated in order for docking to take place. Hence the
upstream protein contains the receptor domain, whose phosphorylation status determines whether the protein can bind its downstream partner and
hence propagate the signal (Figure 14.12).

Some signal transduction cascades do not involve the direct transfer of the
external signal to the genome but instead utilize an indirect means of influencing transcription. The indirectness is provided by second messengers,
which are less specific internal signaling compounds that transduce the signal from a cell surface receptor in several directions so that a variety of cellular activities, not just transcription, respond to the one signal.
P

In Section 14.1.1 we saw how glucose modulates the catabolite activator protein by influencing cAMP levels in bacteria (see Figure 14.7). Cyclic
nucleotides are also important second messengers in eukaryotic cells. Some
cell surface receptors have guanylate cyclase activity, and so convert GTP to
cGMP, but most receptors in this family work indirectly by influencing the
activity of cytoplasmic cyclases and decyclases. These cyclases and decyclases determine the cellular levels of cGMP and cAMP, which in turn control
the activities of various target enzymes. The latter include protein kinase A,
which is stimulated by cAMP. One of the functions of protein kinase A is to
phosphorylate, and hence activate, a transcription activator called CREB.
This is one of several proteins that influence the activity of a variety of genes
by interacting with a second activator, p300/CBP, which is able to modify histone proteins and so affect chromatin structure and nucleosome positioning
(Sections 10.2.1 and 10.2.2).
As well as being activated indirectly by cAMP, p300/CBP responds to another
second messenger, calcium. The calcium ion concentration is substantially
lower inside than outside the cell, so proteins that open calcium channels in
the cell membrane allow calcium ions to enter. This can be induced by extracellular signals that activate tyrosine kinase receptors which in turn activate
phospholipases that cleave phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate, a lipid
component of the inner cell membrane, into inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate
(Ins(1,4,5)P3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG). Ins(1,4,5)P3 opens calcium
channels (Figure 14.13). Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG are themselves second messengers that can initiate other signal transduction cascades. Both the calcium- and the lipid-induced cascades target transcription activators, but
only indirectly: the primary targets are other proteins. Calcium, for example,

How do cell biologists unravel the complexities of signal transduction pathways? To answer this question, we will examine some of the recent research
directed at the signaling pathway activated by transforming growth factor-b
(TGF-b), a family of some 30 related polypeptides that control processes such
as cell division and differentiation in vertebrates. The cell surface receptors
for TGF-b are serine–threonine kinases (see Table 14.2), which activate a variety of target proteins within the cell. Part of the signal transduction process
initiated by TGF-b binding involves a set of proteins called the SMAD family,
the name being an abbreviation of “SMA/MAD related,” referring to the proteins in Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans, respectively,
which were the original members of the family to be isolated.
Initially, five SMADs were discovered in vertebrate cells. Four of these—
Smad1, Smad2, Smad3, and Smad5—are called receptor-regulated SMADs
because they associate directly with the cell surface receptor. Each of these
SMADs is specific for a different type of serine–threonine receptor and hence
responds to different members of the TGF-b family of signaling compounds.
Binding of the extracellular signal induces a receptor to phosphorylate its
SMAD, which then associates with Smad4, moves to the nucleus, and via
interactions with DNA-binding proteins, activates a set of target genes
(Figure 14.14A). Smad4 is therefore a co-mediator that participates in the signaling pathway of each of the other four SMADs. The SMAD system is a second example of signal transduction with one step between receptor and
genome, similar to the STAT pathway described above.

Figure 14.14 Understanding the SMAD
signaling pathway. (A) Outline of the
signaling pathway. Smad1 is shown being
activated by a TGF-b receptor. The same
pathway applies to Smad2, Smad3, and
Smad5. (B) Two models for the inhibitory
effects of Smad6 (shown in this diagram)
and Smad7.

This interpretation of the SMAD pathway was complicated by the discovery
of two additional SMADs—numbers 6 and 7—that do not fit into the scheme.
These SMADs lack the amino acid sequence motif serine–serine–X–serine
(where X is valine or methionine), present in the C-terminal region of Smad1,
Smad2, Smad3, and Smad5, and which is phosphorylated by the receptor.
Clearly, therefore, Smad6 and Smad7 do not respond directly to attachment
of the extracellular signals to the receptor protein. Are they co-mediators similar to Smad4, or do they have some other role in TGF-b signal transduction?

Permanent and Semipermanent Changes in Genome Activity

The first step in understanding the functions of Smad6 and Smad7 was to
determine the effect of overexpression of these proteins on TGF-b signal
transduction. Overexpression was achieved by attaching the Smad6 or Smad7
gene to a strong promoter and then using cloning techniques to introduce
the gene into cultured cells. The outcome was that nuclear genes normally
switched on by TGF-b became nonresponsive to the extracellular signal in
cells overexpressing Smad6 or Smad7. This result gave the first indication that
Smad6 and Smad7 have inhibitory effects on the TGF-b pathway.
Two models have been proposed to explain how the inhibitory SMADs, as
Smad6 and Smad7 are now called, repress the TGF-b pathway (Figure 14.14B).
The first model is based on the observation that in cell extracts the Smad6
and Smad7 proteins are associated with the intracellular parts of the cell surface receptors. The hypothesis is that Smad6 and Smad7 inhibit signal transduction by preventing the activated receptors from phosphorylating the
other SMADs. This model probably explains the inhibitory effects of overexpression of Smad6 and Smad7, but in normal cells there may not be enough
copies of these proteins to block the cell surface receptors entirely. An alternative model has therefore been proposed, in which the inhibitory SMADs
bind to one or more of the other SMADs, removing these from the pathway
and hence stopping signal transduction. There is good evidence that this type
of interaction is the explanation for the inhibitory effect that Smad6 has on
Smad1. Yeast two-hybrid studies (Section 6.2.2) have shown that these two
SMADs interact, and after binding to Smad6, Smad1 is unable to influence
the transcriptional activators that it normally stimulates, even after it has
been phosphorylated by the cell surface receptors.
Whatever the mechanism for Smad6 and Smad7 activity, the discovery of
these inhibitory SMADs shows that TGF-b signaling via the SMAD pathway is
more flexible than was originally envisaged. Rather than being an all-or-nothing response, the activity of the receptor-regulated SMADs can be modified
by the inhibitory effects of Smad6 and Smad7, these proteins presumably
responding to as-yet-unidentified intra- and/or intercellular signals in order
to modulate the effects of TGF-b binding in an appropriate way.

14.2 Permanent and Semipermanent Changes in
Genome Activity
Transient changes in genome activity are, by definition, readily reversible, the
genome expression pattern reverting to its original state when the external
stimulus is removed or replaced by a contradictory stimulus. In contrast, the
permanent and semipermanent changes in genome activity that underlie
cellular differentiation must persist for long periods, and ideally should be
maintained even when the stimulus that originally induced them has disappeared. We therefore anticipate that the regulatory mechanisms bringing
about these longer-term changes will involve systems additional to the modulation of transcription activators and repressors. This expectation is correct.
We will look at three mechanisms:
G

Changes resulting from physical rearrangement of the genome.

G

Changes due to chromatin structure.

G

Changes maintained by feedback loops.

Mating type is the equivalent of sex in yeasts and other eukaryotic microorganisms. Because these organisms reproduce mainly by vegetative cell division, there is the possibility that a population, being derived from just one or
a few ancestral cells, will be largely or completely composed of a single mating type and so will not be able to reproduce sexually. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae and some other species this problem is avoided because cells are able
to change sex by the process called mating-type switching.
The two S. cerevisiae mating types are called a and a. Each mating type
secretes a short polypeptide pheromone (12 amino acids in length for a and
13 for a) that binds to receptors on the surfaces of cells of the opposite mating type. Binding of the pheromone initiates a MAP kinase signal transduction
pathway (see Figure 14.10) that alters the genome expression profile within
the cell, leading to subtle morphological and physiological changes that convert the cell into a gamete able to participate in sexual reproduction. Mixing
two haploid strains of opposite mating type therefore stimulates formation of
gametes which fuse to produce a diploid zygote. Meiosis occurs within the
zygote, giving rise to a tetrad of four haploid ascospores, contained in a structure called an ascus. The ascus bursts open, releasing the ascospores, which
then divide by mitosis to produce new haploid vegetative cells (Figure 14.15).
The mating type is specified by the MAT gene, located on chromosome III.
This gene has two alleles, MATa and MATa, a haploid yeast cell displaying the
mating type corresponding to whichever allele it possesses. Elsewhere on
chromosome III are two additional MAT-like genes, called HMRa and HMLa
(Figure 14.16). These have the same sequences as MATa and MATa, respectively, but neither gene is expressed because upstream of each one is a
silencer that represses transcription initiation. These two genes are called
“silent mating-type cassettes.” Their silencing involves the Sir proteins, several of which have histone deacetylase activity (Section 10.2.1), indicating
that silencing involves changes in the chromatin structure in the region of
HMRa and HMLa.
Mating-type switching is initiated by the HO endonuclease, which makes a
double-strand cut at a 24 bp sequence located within the MAT gene. This
enables a gene conversion event to take place. We examine the details of gene
conversion in Section 17.1.1; all that concerns us at the moment is that one of
the free 3¢ ends produced by the endonuclease can be extended by DNA synthesis, using one of the two silent cassettes as the template (see Figure 14.16).
The newly synthesized DNA subsequently replaces the DNA currently at the
MAT locus. The silent cassette chosen as the template is usually the one that is
different to the allele originally at MAT, so replacement with the newly synthesized strand converts the MAT gene from MATa to MATa, or vice versa. This
results in mating-type switching.
The MAT genes code for regulatory proteins (one in the case of MATa and two
for MATa) that interact with a transcription activator, MCM1, thus determining

which set of genes are switched on by this factor. The MATa and MATa gene
products have different effects on MCM1, and so specify different allele-specific genome expression patterns. These expression patterns are maintained in
a semipermanent fashion until another MAT gene conversion occurs.

Genome rearrangements are responsible for immunoglobulin
and T-cell receptor diversities
In vertebrates, there are two striking examples of the use of DNA rearrangements to achieve permanent changes in genome activity. These two examples, which are very similar, are responsible for the generation of
immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor diversities.
Immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors are related proteins that are synthesized by B and T lymphocytes, respectively. Both types of protein become
attached to the outer surfaces of their cells, and immunoglobulins are also
released into the bloodstream. The proteins help to protect the body against
invasion by bacteria, viruses, and other unwanted substances by binding to
these antigens, as they are called. During its lifetime, an organism could be
exposed to any number of a vast range of antigens, which means that the
immune system must be able to synthesize an equally vast range of
immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor proteins. In fact, humans can make
approximately 108 different immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor proteins.
But there are only 3.5 ¥ 104 genes in the human genome, so where do all these
proteins come from?
To understand the answer we will look at the structure of a typical
immunoglobulin protein. Each immunoglobulin is a tetramer of four
polypeptides linked by disulfide bonds (Figure 14.17). There are two long
“heavy” chains and two short “light” chains. When the sequences of different
heavy chains are compared it becomes clear that the variability between
them lies mainly in the N-terminal regions of these polypeptides, the C-terminal parts being very similar, or “constant,” in all heavy chains. The same is
true for the light chains, except that two families, k and l, can be distinguished, differing in the sequences of their constant regions.
In the vertebrate genomes, there are no complete genes for the immunoglobulin heavy and light polypeptides. Instead, these proteins are specified by gene
segments. The heavy-chain segments are on chromosome 14 and comprise 11

mating type a. The HO endonuclease cuts
the MATa locus, initiating gene conversion
by the HMLa locus. The result is that the

Each immunoglobulin protein is made up of
two heavy and two light chains, linked by
disulfide bonds. Each heavy chain is 446
amino acids in length and consists of a
variable region (shown in red) spanning
amino acids 1–108 followed by a constant
region. Each light chain is 214 amino acids,

chains: these and other interactions fold the
protein into a more complex threedimensional structure.

27 DH gene segments, and 9 JH gene segments, these last three types coding for
different versions of the V (variable), D (diverse), and J (joining) components
of the variable part of the heavy chain (Table 14.3; Figure 14.18). The entire
heavy-chain locus stretches over several megabase pairs. A similar arrangement is seen with the light-chain loci on chromosomes 2 (k locus) and 22 (l
locus), the only difference being that the light chains do not have D segments
(Table 14.3).
During the early stage of B lymphocyte development, the immunoglobulin
loci in its genome undergo rearrangements. Within the heavy-chain locus,
these rearrangements link one of the VH gene segments with one of the DH
gene segments, and then link this V–D combination with a JH gene segment
(Figure 14.19). These rearrangements occur by an unusual type of recombination, catalyzed by a pair of proteins called RAG1 and RAG2, with the positions
at which the breakage and reunion reactions must occur in order to link the
gene segments marked by a series of 8 bp and 9 bp consensus sequences. The
end result is an exon that contains the complete open reading frame specifying the VH, DH, and JH segments of the immunoglobulin protein. This exon
becomes linked to a CH segment exon by splicing during the transcription
process, creating a complete heavy-chain mRNA that can be translated into
an immunoglobulin protein that is specific for just that one lymphocyte. A
similar series of DNA rearrangements results in the lymphocyte’s light-chain
V–J exon being constructed at either the k or l locus, and once again splicing
attaches a light-chain C segment exon when the mRNA is synthesized.
Despite its name, the constant region is not identical in every immunoglobulin protein. The small variations that occur result in five different classes
of immunoglobulin—IgA, IgD, IgE, IgG, and IgM—each with its own specialized role in the immune system. Initially, each B lymphocyte synthesizes an
IgM molecule, the CH segment of which is specified by the Cm sequence that
lies at the 5¢ end of the CH segment cluster. As shown in Figure 14.19, later in
its development the immature cell might also synthesize some IgD proteins,
utilizing the second CH sequence in the cluster (Cd), the exon for this
sequence becoming attached to the V–D–J segment by alternative splicing.
Later in their lifetimes, when they have reached maturity, some B lymphocytes undergo a second type of class switching, which results in a complete
change in the type of immunoglobulin that the lymphocyte synthesizes. This
second class switching requires a further recombination event that deletes
the Cm and Cd sequence along with the part of the chromosome between this
region and the CH segment specifying the class of immunoglobulin that the

lymphocyte will now synthesize. For example, for the lymphocyte to switch to
synthesis of IgG, the most prevalent type of immunoglobulin made by mature
lymphocytes, then the deletion will place one of the Cg segments, which specify the IgG heavy chain, at the 5¢ end of the cluster (Figure 14.20). Class switching is therefore a second example of genome rearrangement occurring during
B lymphocyte development. The mechanism is distinct from V–D–J joining
and the recombination event does not involve the RAG proteins.
Diversity of T-cell receptors is based on similar rearrangements which link V,
D, J, and C gene segments in different combinations to produce cell-specific
genes. Each receptor comprises a pair of b molecules, which are similar to the
immunoglobulin heavy chain, and two a molecules, which resemble the
immunoglobulin k light chains. As with immunoglobulins, the T-cell receptors become embedded in the cell membrane and enable the lymphocyte to
recognize and respond to extracellular antigens.

14.2.2 Changes in chromatin structure
Some of the effects that chromatin structure can have on genome expression
were described in Section 10.2. These range from the modulation of transcription initiation at an individual promoter by nucleosome positioning, through
to the silencing of large segments of DNA locked-up in higher-order chromatin structure. The latter is an important means of bringing about long-term
changes in genome activity and is implicated in a number of regulatory
events. One of these concerns the yeast mating-type loci that we looked at earlier in this section, the silencing of the HMRa and HMLa cassettes resulting

mainly from these loci being buried in inaccessible chromatin in response to
the influence of their upstream silencer sequences. X inactivation (Section
10.3.1) also involves the formation of inaccessible chromatin, in this case along
virtually the entire length of one of the two X chromosomes in a female nucleus.
One other example of chromatin silencing merits attention. This is a system
that we will meet again later in the chapter when we look at development
processes in the fruit fly. It concerns the Polycomb gene family, which comprises some 30 genes that code for proteins that bind to DNA sequences,
called Polycomb response elements, and induce formation of heterochromatin, the condensed form of chromatin that prevents transcription of the
genes that it contains (Figure 14.21). Each response element is approximately
10 kb in length but does not appear to contain specific Polycomb binding
sites, suggesting that additional proteins act as intermediaries in Polycomb
attachment. A candidate for this intermediary role is the non-Polycomb protein called Dorsal switch protein 1 (DSP1), which binds to 5¢–GAAAA–3¢
sequences present in the core region of a Polycomb response element.
Mutations to these sequences that prevent DSP1 binding also prevent recruitment of Polycomb proteins in experimental systems. Whatever the mechanism, the result of Polycomb attachment is nucleation of heterochromatin
around the Polycomb proteins, the heterochromatin then propagating along
the DNA for tens of kilobases in either direction.
The regions that become silenced contain homeotic genes which, as we will
see in Section 14.3.4, specify the development of the individual body parts of
the fly. As only one body part must be specified at a particular position in the
fruit fly, it is important that a cell expresses only the correct homeotic gene.
This is ensured by the action of Polycomb, which permanently silences the
homeotic genes that must be switched off. Polycomb proteins do not, however, determine which genes will be silenced: expression of these genes is
already repressed before the Polycomb proteins bind to their response elements. The role of Polycomb is therefore to maintain rather than initiate gene

silencing. An important point is that the heterochromatin induced by
Polycomb is heritable: after division, the two new cells retain the heterochromatin established in the parent cell. This type of regulation of genome activity is therefore permanent not only in a single cell, but also in a cell lineage.
The trithorax proteins act in a similar manner to Polycomb, but have the
opposite effect: they maintain an open chromatin state in the regions of
active genes, the targets including the same homeotic genes as those that are
silenced, in different body parts, by Polycomb proteins. The modes of action
of trithorax and Polycomb may be closely linked, as there is evidence that
trithorax proteins attach to their target sites via a mediator protein, called
GAGA, which binds to sequences within Polycomb response elements. Some
mutations abolish both Polycomb and trithorax activity, indicating that the
two systems may share common components.

14.2.3 Genome regulation by feedback loops
The final mechanism that we will consider for bringing about long-term
changes in genome activity involves the use of a feedback loop. In this system, a regulatory protein activates its own transcription so that once its gene
has been switched on, it is expressed continuously (Figure 14.22). A number
of examples of this type of feedback regulation are known:
G

The MyoD transcription activator, which is involved in muscle development, is one of the best-understood examples of cellular differentiation in
vertebrates. A cell becomes committed to becoming a muscle cell when it
begins to express the myoD gene. The product of this gene is a transcription activator that targets a number of other genes coding for muscle-specific proteins, such as actin and myosin, and is also indirectly responsible
for one of the key features of muscle cells—the absence of a normal cell
cycle, these cells being stopped in the G1 phase (Section 15.3.1). The
MyoD protein also binds upstream of myoD, ensuring that its own gene is
continuously expressed. The result of this positive feedback loop is that
the cell continues to synthesize the muscle-specific proteins and remains
a muscle cell. The differentiated state is heritable because cell division is
accompanied by transmission of MyoD to the daughter cells, ensuring
that these are also muscle cells.

G

Deformed of Drosophila is one of several proteins coded by homeotic
selector genes and is responsible for specifying segment identity in the
fruit fly (Section 14.3.4). The Deformed (Dfd) protein is responsible for the
identity of the head segments. To perform this function, Dfd must be continuously expressed in the relevant cells. This is achieved by a feedback
system, Dfd binding to an enhancer located upstream of the Dfd gene.
Feedback autoregulation also controls the expression of at least some
homeotic selector genes of vertebrates.

pathway is to reach a successful culmination. With humans, this developmental pathway results in an adult containing 1013 cells differentiated into
approximately 250 specialized types, the activity of each individual cell coordinated with that of every other cell. Developmental processes of such complexity might appear intractable, even to the powerful investigative tools of
modern molecular biology, but remarkably good progress toward understanding them has been made in recent years. The research that has underpinned this progress has been designed around three guiding principles:
G

It should be possible to describe and comprehend the genetic and biochemical events that underlie differentiation of individual cell types. This
in turn means that an understanding of how specialized tissues, and even
complex body parts, are constructed should be within reach.

G

The signaling processes that coordinate events in different cells should be
amenable to study. We saw in Section 14.1 that a start is being made to
describing these systems at the molecular level.

G

There should be similarities and parallels between developmental
processes in different organisms, reflecting common evolutionary origins.
This means that information relevant to human development can be
obtained from studies of model organisms chosen for the relative simplicity of their developmental pathways.

Developmental biology encompasses areas of genetics, molecular biology, cell
biology, physiology, biochemistry, and systems biology. We are concerned only
with the role of the genome in development and so will not attempt a wideranging overview of developmental research in all its guises. Instead we will
concentrate on four model systems of increasing complexity in order to investigate the types of change in genome activity that occur during development.

14.3.1 The lysogenic cycle of bacteriophage l
A bacteriophage that infects Escherichia coli might seem an odd place to
begin a study of genome regulation during development. But this is exactly
where molecular biologists began the lengthy program of research that today
is revealing the underlying genomic basis to development in humans and
other vertebrates. We will therefore follow this same progression from the relatively simple to the relatively complex.
In Section 9.1.1 we learnt that lysogenic bacteriophages such as l can follow
two alternative replication pathways after infection of a host cell. As well as
the lytic pathway, during which new phages are assembled and released from
the cell soon after the initial infection (after 45 minutes for l), these phages
can also pursue a lysogenic cycle characterized by insertion of the phage DNA
into the host chromosome. The integrated prophage remains quiescent for
many bacterial generations until a chemical or physical stimulus linked to
DNA damage induces excision of the l genome, rapid assembly of phages,
and lysis of the host cell (see Figures 9.4 and 9.5).

Bacteriophage l must make a choice between lysis and lysogeny
The ability of bacteriophages such as l to follow a lysogenic infection cycle
raises three questions: how does the phage “decide” whether to follow the
lytic or lysogenic cycle, how is lysogeny maintained, and how is the prophage
induced to break lysogeny? A considerable amount is known about genome
expression during l infection, so much so that very detailed and complex
answers can be given for these questions.

Genomes Chapter 14

6/4/06

3:51 pm

Page 445

Regulation of Genome Activity During Development

The first step in the lytic infection cycle is expression of the two immediateearly l genes, which are called N and cro. These are transcribed from two promoters, PL and PR, respectively (Figure 14.23A). Protein N is the antiterminator which enables the host RNA polymerase to ignore the termination signals
that it encounters immediately downstream of the N and cro coding
sequences and to transcribe the delayed-early genes (see Figure 12.9). These
genes include cII and cIII, which together activate a third promoter PRM,
resulting in transcription of cI. This is an all-important gene as it codes for the
l repressor protein, the key master switch that shuts down the lytic cycle and
maintains lysogeny. The repressor does this by binding to the operators OL
and OR, adjacent to PL and PR, respectively (Figure 14.23B). As a result almost
the entire l genome is silenced, because PL and PR direct transcription not
only of the immediate-early and delayed-early genes, but also of the late
genes, which code for the proteins needed for assembly of new phages and
host cell lysis. One of the few genes to remain active is int, which is transcribed from its own promoter. The integrase protein coded by this gene catalyzes the site-specific recombination which inserts the l DNA into the host
genome. Lysogeny is maintained for numerous cell divisions because the cI
gene is continuously expressed, albeit at a low level, so that the amount of cI
repressor present in the cell is always enough to keep PL and PR switched off.
This continued expression of cI occurs because the cI repressor, when bound
to OR, not only blocks transcription from PR, but also stimulates transcription
from its own promoter PRM. The dual role of the cI repressor is therefore the
key to lysogeny.
Once cI is expressed, the repressor protein prevents entry into the lytic cycle
and ensures that lysogeny is set up and maintained. But l does not always
enter the lysogenic cycle—on some occasions an infection proceeds immediately to host lysis. This is because of the activity of the second immediateearly gene, cro, which also codes for a repressor, but in this case one that prevents transcription of cI (Figure 14.23C). The decision between lysis and
lysogeny is therefore determined by the outcome of a race between cI and cro.
If the cI repressor is synthesized more quickly than the Cro repressor, then
genome expression is blocked and lysogeny follows. However, if cro wins the
race, then the Cro repressor blocks cI expression before enough cI repressor
has been synthesized to silence the genome. As a result, the phage enters the
lytic infection cycle. The decision appears to be random, depending on
chance events that lead to either the cI or the Cro repressor accumulating the
quickest in the cell, although environmental conditions can have an influence. Growth on a rich medium, for example, shifts the balance toward the
lytic cycle, presumably because it is beneficial to produce new phages when
the host cells are proliferating. This shift is brought about by activation of proteases that degrade the cII protein, reducing the ability of the cII–cIII combination to switch on transcription of the cI repressor gene.
If the bacteriophage enters the lysogenic cycle, then this state is maintained
as long as the cI repressor is bound to the operators OL and OR. The prophage
will therefore be induced if the level of active cI repressor declines below a
certain point. This may happen by chance, leading to spontaneous induction, or may occur in response to physical or chemical stimuli. These stimuli
activate a general protective mechanism in E. coli, the SOS response. Part of
the SOS response is expression of an E. coli gene, recA, whose product inactivates the cI repressor by cleaving it in half. This switches on expression of
the early genes, enabling the phage to enter the lytic cycle. Inactivation of the

cI repressor also means that transcription of cI is no longer stimulated,
avoiding the possibility of lysogeny being reestablished through the synthesis of more cI repressor. Inactivation of the cI repressor therefore leads to
induction of the prophage.
What do we learn from this model system?

A simple genetic switch can determine which of two developmental pathways is followed by a cell.

Genetic switches can involve a combination of activation and repression
of different promoters.

It is possible to reprogram a developmental pathway, and transfer to an
alternative pathway, in response to appropriate stimuli.

14.3.2 Sporulation in Bacillus
The second system that we will examine is formation of spores by the bacterium Bacillus subtilis. As with l lysogeny this is not, strictly speaking, a
developmental pathway, merely a type of cellular differentiation, but the
process illustrates two of the fundamental issues that have to be addressed
when genuine development in multicellular organisms is studied. These
issues are how a series of changes in genome activity over time is controlled,
and how signaling establishes coordination between events occurring in different cells. The advantages of Bacillus as a model system are that it is easy to
grow in the laboratory and is amenable to study by genetic and molecular
biology techniques such as analysis of mutants and sequencing of genes.

Sporulation involves coordinated activities in two distinct cell types
Bacillus is one of several genera of bacteria that produce endospores in
response to unfavorable environmental conditions. These spores are highly
resistant to physical and chemical abuse and can survive for decades or even
centuries—the possibility of infection with anthrax spores produced by B.
anthracis is taken very seriously by archaeologists excavating sites containing
human and animal remains. Resistance is due to the specialized nature of the
spore coat, which is impermeable to many chemicals, and to biochemical
changes within the spore that retard the decay of DNA and other polymers
and enable the spore to survive a prolonged period of dormancy.
In the laboratory, sporulation is usually induced by nutrient starvation. This
causes the bacteria to abandon their normal vegetative mode of cell division,
which involves synthesis of a septum (or cross-wall) in the center of the cell.
Instead the cells construct an unusual septum, one that is thinner than normal, at one end of the cell (Figure 14.24). This produces two cellular compartments, the smaller of which is called the prespore and the larger the mother
cell. As sporulation proceeds, the prespore becomes entirely engulfed by the
mother cell. By now the two cells are committed to different but coordinated
differentiation pathways, the prespore undergoing the biochemical changes
that enable it to become dormant, and the mother cell constructing the
resistant coat around the spore and eventually dying.

Special s subunits control genome activity during sporulation
Changes in genome activity during sporulation are controlled largely by the
synthesis of special s subunits that change the promoter specificity of the
Bacillus RNA polymerase. Recall that the s subunit is the part of the RNA

polymerase that recognizes the bacterial promoter sequence, and that
replacement of one s subunit with another with a different DNA-binding
specificity can result in a different set of genes being transcribed (Section
11.3.1). We have seen how this simple control system is used by E. coli in
response to heat stress (see Figure 11.23). It is also the key to the changes in
genome activity that occur during sporulation.
The standard B. subtilis s subunits are called sA and sH. These subunits are
synthesized in vegetative cells and enable the RNA polymerase to recognize
promoters for all the genes it needs to transcribe in order to maintain normal
growth and cell division. In the prespore and mother cell these subunits are
replaced by sF and sE, respectively, which recognize different promoter
sequences and so give rise to large-scale changes in genome expression patterns. The master switch from vegetative growth to spore formation is provided by a protein called SpoOA, which is present in vegetative cells but in an
inactive form. This protein is activated by phosphorylation, via a cascade of
protein kinases that respond to various extracellular signals that indicate the
presence of an environmental stress such as lack of nutrients. The initial
response is provided by three kinases, called KinA, KinB, and KinC, which
phosphorylate themselves and then pass the phosphate via SpoOF and

the normal vegetative mode of cell division,
involving formation of a septum across the
center of the bacterium and resulting in two
identical daughter cells. The lower part of
the diagram shows sporulation, in which the
septum forms near one end of the cell,
leading to a mother cell and prespore of
different sizes. Eventually the mother cell
completely engulfs the prespore. At the end
of the process, the mature, resistant spore
is released.

SpoOB to SpoOA (Figure 14.25). Activated SpoOA is a transcription factor that
modulates the expression of various genes transcribed by the vegetative RNA
polymerase and hence recognized by the regular sA and sH subunits. The
genes that are switched on include those for sF and sE, resulting in the switch
to prespore and mother cell differentiation (Figure 14.26).

so should be active only in this cell, and sE is mother-cell specific. A means is
therefore needed of activating or inactivating the appropriate subunit in the
correct cell. This is thought to be achieved as follows (Figure 14.27):
G

sF is activated by release from a complex with a second protein, SpoIIAB.
This is controlled by a third protein, SpoIIAA, which, when unphosphorylated, can also attach to SpoIIAB and prevent the latter from binding to
sF. If SpoIIAA is unphosphorylated then sF is released and is active; when
SpoIIAA is phosphorylated then sF remains bound to SpoIIAB and so is
inactive. In the mother cell, SpoIIAB phosphorylates SpoIIAA and so keeps
sF in its bound, inactive state. But in the prespore, SpoIIAB’s attempts to
phosphorylate SpoIIAA are antagonized by yet another protein, SpoIIE,
and so sF is released and becomes active. SpoIIE’s ability to antagonize
SpoIIAB in the prespore but not the mother cell derives from the fact that
SpoIIE molecules are bound to the membrane on the surface of the septum. Because the prespore is much smaller than the mother cell, but the
septum surface area is similar in both, the concentration of SpoIIE is
greater in the prespore, and this enables it to antagonize SpoIIAB.

G

sE is activated by proteolytic cleavage of a precursor protein. The protease
that carries out this cleavage is the SpoIIGA protein, which spans the septum between the prespore and mother cell. The protease domain, which
is on the mother-cell side of the septum, is activated by binding of SpoIIR
to a receptor domain on the prespore side. It is a typical receptor-mediated signal transduction system (Section 14.1.2). The gene for SpoIIR is
one of those whose promoter is recognized specifically by sF, so activation
of the protease, and conversion of pre-sE to active sE, occurs once sFdirected transcription is underway in the prespore.

Activation of sF and sE is just the beginning of the story. In the prespore,
about 1 hour after its activation, sF responds to an unknown signal (possibly
from the mother cell) which results in a slight change in genome activity in
the spore. This includes transcription of a gene for another s subunit, sG,
which recognizes promoters upstream of genes whose products are required
during the later stages of spore differentiation. One of these proteins is
SpoIVB, which activates another septum-bound protease, SpoIVF (Figure
14.28). This protease then activates a second mother-cell s subunit, sK, which
is coded by a sE-transcribed gene but retained in the mother cell in an inactive form until the signal for its activation is received from the prespore. sK
directs transcription of the genes whose products are needed during the later
stages of the mother-cell differentiation pathway.
To summarize, the key features of Bacillus sporulation are as follows:
G

The master protein, SpoOA, responds to external stimuli via a cascade of
phosphorylation events to determine if and when the switch to sporulation should occur.

14.3.3 Vulva development in Caenorhabditis elegans
B. subtilis is a unicellular organism and, although sporulation involves the
coordinated differentiation of two cell types, it can hardly be looked upon as
comparable to the developmental processes that occur in multicellular organisms. Sporulation provides pointers to the general ways in which genome
activity might be regulated during the development of a multicellular organism, but it does not indicate the specific events to expect. We therefore need to
examine development in a simple multicellular eukaryote.

C. elegans is a model for multicellular eukaryotic development

AA

Research with the microscopic nematode worm C. elegans (Figure 14.29) was
initiated by Sydney Brenner in the 1960s with the aim of utilizing it as a simple model for multicellular eukaryotic development. C. elegans is easy to grow
in the laboratory and has a short generation time, measured in days but still
convenient for genetic analysis. The worm is transparent at all stages of its life
cycle, so internal examination is possible without killing the animal. This is an
important point because it has enabled researchers to follow the entire developmental process of the worm at the cellular level. Every cell division in the
pathway from fertilized egg to adult worm has been charted, and every point
at which a cell adopts a specialized role has been identified. In addition, the
complete connectivity of the 302 cells that comprise the nervous system of
the worm has been mapped.

AB

The genome of C. elegans is relatively small, just 97 Mb (see Table 7.2), and the
entire sequence is known. Analysis of the sequence, using many of the techniques described in Chapter 5, is beginning to assign functions to the
unknown genes and to establish links between genome activity and the developmental pathways. The objective is a complete genetic description of development in C. elegans, a goal that is attainable in the not-too-distant future.

Determination of cell fate during development of the C. elegans vulva
A critical feature that underpins the usefulness of C. elegans as a tool for
research is the fact that its development is more or less invariant: the pattern
of cell division and differentiation is virtually the same in every individual.
This appears to be due in large part to cell–cell signaling, which induces each
cell to follow its appropriate differentiation pathway. To illustrate this we will
look at development of the C. elegans vulva.
Most C. elegans worms are hermaphrodites, meaning that they have both
male and female sex organs. The vulva is part of the female sex apparatus,
being the tube through which sperm enter and fertilized eggs are laid. The
adult vulva comprises 22 cells, which are the progeny of three ancestral cells
originally located in a row on the undersurface of the developing worm
(Figure 14.30). Each of these ancestral cells becomes committed to the differentiation pathway that leads to production of vulva cells. The central cell,
called P6.p, adopts the “primary vulva cell fate” and divides to produce eight
new cells. The other two cells—P5.p and P7.p—take on the “secondary vulva

A critical aspect of vulva development is that it must occur in the correct position relative to the gonad, the structure containing the egg cells. If the vulva
develops in the wrong place then the gonad will not receive sperm and the
egg cells will never be fertilized. The positional information needed by the
vulva progenitor cells is provided by a cell within the gonad called the anchor
cell (Figure 14.31). The importance of the anchor cell has been demonstrated
by experiments in which it is artificially destroyed in the embryonic worm: in
the absence of the anchor cell, a vulva does not develop. The implication is
that the anchor cell secretes an extracellular signaling compound that
induces P5.p, P6.p, and P7.p to differentiate. This signaling compound is the
protein called LIN-3, coded by the lin-3 gene.
Why does P6.p adopt the primary cell fate whereas P5.p and P7.p take on secondary cell fates? There are two possibilities. The first is that LIN-3 forms a
concentration gradient and therefore has different effects on P6.p, the cell
which is closest to it, and the more distant P5.p and P7.p, as shown in Figure
14.31. Evidence in favor of this idea comes from studies showing that isolated
cells adopt the secondary fate when exposed to low levels of LIN-3.
Alternatively, the signal that commits P5.p and P7.p to their secondary fates
might not come directly from the anchor cell but via P6.p in the form of a different extracellular signaling compound whose synthesis by P6.p is switched
on by LIN-3 activation. This hypothesis is supported by the abnormal features displayed by certain mutants in which more than three cells become
committed to vulva development. With these mutants there is more than one
primary cell, but each one is invariably surrounded by two secondary cells,
suggesting that in the living worm, adoption of the secondary cell fate is
dependent on the presence of an adjacent primary cell.
There are other instructive features of vulva development in C. elegans. The
first is that the signaling process that commits P6.p to its primary cell fate has
many similarities with the MAP kinase signal transduction system of vertebrates (see Figure 14.10). The cell surface receptor for LIN-3 is a protein
kinase called LET-23 which, when activated by binding LIN-3, initiates a
series of intracellular reactions that leads to activation of a MAP-kinase-like
protein, which in turn switches on a variety of transcription activators.
Unfortunately, the target genes have not yet been delineated in either the primary or secondary vulva progenitor cells, but the system is open to study.
A second noteworthy feature is that as well as the activation signal provided
by the anchor cell in the form of LIN-3, the vulva progenitor cells are also subject to the deactivating effects of a second signaling compound secreted by
the hypodermal cell, a multinuclear sheath that surrounds most of the
worm’s body. This repressive signal is overcome by the positive signals that

induce P5.p, P6.p, and P7.p to differentiate, but prevents the unwanted differentiation of three adjacent cells, P3.p, P4.p, and P8.p, each of which can
become committed to vulva development if the repressive signal malfunctions, for example in a mutant worm.
In summary, the general concepts to emerge from the study of vulva development in C. elegans are as follows:
G

In a multicellular organism, positional information is important: the correct structure must develop at the appropriate place.

G

The commitment to differentiation of a small number of progenitor cells
can lead to construction of a multicellular structure.

G

Cell–cell signaling can utilize a concentration gradient to induce different
responses in cells at different positions relative to the signaling cell.

G

A cell might be subject to competitive signaling, where one signal tells it to
do one thing and a second signal tells it to do the opposite.

14.3.4 Development in Drosophila melanogaster
The last organism whose development we will study is Drosophila
melanogaster. The experimental history of the fruit fly dates back to 1910
when Thomas Hunt Morgan first used this organism as a model system in
genetic research. For Morgan, the advantages of Drosophila were its small
size, enabling large numbers to be studied in a single experiment, its minimal nutritional requirements (the flies like bananas), and the presence in

the primary vulva cell fate. P5.p and P7.p
(shown in yellow) are further away from
the anchor cell and so are exposed to a
lower concentration of LIN-3 and become
secondary vulva cells. As described in the
text, there is evidence that commitment of
the secondary cells to their fates is also
influenced by signals from the primary
vulva cell.

natural populations of occasional variants with easily recognized genetic
characteristics such as unusual eye colors. Morgan was not aware that other
advantages are a small genome (180 Mb; see Table 7.2) and the fact that gene
isolation is aided by the presence in the salivary glands of “giant” chromosomes. These are made up of multiple copies of the same DNA molecule laid
side by side, displaying banding patterns that can be correlated with the
physical map of each chromosome to pinpoint the positions of desired
genes. But Morgan did foresee that Drosophila might become an important
organism for developmental research, a topic that he was as interested in as
we are today.

The major contribution that Drosophila has made to our understanding of
development has been through the insights it has provided into how an
undifferentiated embryo acquires positional information that eventually
results in the construction of complex body parts at the correct places in the
adult organism. Although in some respects Drosophila is quite unusual in its
embryonic organization (as we will see in the next section), the genetic mechanisms that specify the fly’s body plan are similar to those in other organisms,
including humans. Knowledge gained from Drosophila has therefore directed
research into areas of human development that for a long time were thought
to be inaccessible. To explore this story we must start with the events that
occur in the developing Drosophila embryo.

Figure 14.32 Early development of the
Drosophila embryo. To begin with, the
embryo is a single syncytium containing a
gradually increasing number of nuclei.
These nuclei migrate to the periphery of the
embryo after about 2 hours, and within
another 30 minutes cells begin to be
constructed. The embryo is approximately
500 mm in length and 170 mm in diameter.

The unusual feature of the early Drosophila embryo is that it is not made up
of lots of cells, as in most organisms, but instead is a single syncytium comprising a mass of cytoplasm and multiple nuclei (Figure 14.32). This structure
persists until 13 successive rounds of nuclear division have produced some
1500 nuclei: only then do individual uninucleate cells start to appear around
the outside of the syncytium, producing the structure called the blastoderm.
Before the blastoderm stage has been reached, the positional information has
begun to be established.
Initially, the positional information that the embryo needs is a definition of
which end is the front (anterior) and which the back (posterior), as well as
similar information relating to up (dorsal) and down (ventral). This information is provided by concentration gradients of proteins that become established in the syncytium. The majority of these proteins are not synthesized
from genes in the embryo, but are translated from mRNAs injected into the
embryo by the mother. To see how these maternal-effect genes work we will
examine the synthesis of Bicoid, one of the four proteins involved in determining the anterior–posterior axis.
The bicoid gene is transcribed in the maternal nurse cells, which are in contact with the egg cells, and the mRNA is injected into the anterior end of the
unfertilized egg. This position is defined by the orientation of the egg cell in
the egg chamber. The bicoid mRNA remains in the anterior region of the egg
cell, attached by its 3¢ untranslated region to the cell’s cytoskeleton. It is not
translated immediately, probably because its poly(A) tail is too short. This is
inferred because translation, which occurs after fertilization of the egg, is preceded by extension of the poly(A) tail through the combined efforts of the
Cortex, Grauzone, and Staufen proteins, all of which are synthesized from
genes in the egg. Bicoid protein then diffuses through the syncytium, setting

Genomes Chapter 14

up a concentration gradient, highest at the anterior end and lowest at the
posterior end (Figure 14.33).
Three other maternal-effect gene products are also involved in setting up the
anterior–posterior gradient. These are the Hunchback, Nanos, and Caudal
proteins. All are injected as mRNAs into the anterior region of the unfertilized
egg. The nanos mRNA is transported to the posterior part of the egg and
attached to the cytoskeleton while it awaits translation. The hunchback and
caudal mRNAs become distributed evenly through the cytoplasm, but their
proteins subsequently form gradients through the action of Bicoid and
Nanos:
G

Bicoid activates the hunchback gene in the embryonic nuclei, supplementing the hunchback mRNA in the anterior region, and represses translation of the maternal caudal mRNA. The result is an increase in the concentration of the Hunchback protein in the anterior region and a decrease
in that of Caudal.

G

Nanos represses translation of hunchback mRNA, contributing further to
the anterior–posterior gradient of the Hunchback protein.

descrtibed in the text. In this diagram, the
concentration gradients are indicated by the
colored bars under the outline of the
embryo.

The net result is a gradient of Bicoid and Hunchback, greater at the anterior
end, and of Nanos and Caudal, greater at the posterior end (see Figure 14.33).
The gradient is supplemented with Torso protein, another maternal-effect
gene product, which accumulates at the extreme anterior and posterior ends.
Similar events result in a dorsal-to-ventral gradient, predominantly of the
protein called Dorsal.

A cascade of gene expression converts positional information into a
segmentation pattern
The body plan of the adult fly, as well as that of the larva, is built from a series
of segments, each with a different structural role. This is clearest in the thorax, which has three segments, each carrying one pair of legs, and the
abdomen, which is made up of eight segments, but is also true for the head,
even though in the head the segmented structure is less visible (Figure 14.34).
The objective of embryo development is therefore production of a young
larva with the correct segmentation pattern.
The gradients established in the embryo by the maternal-effect gene products are the first stage in formation of the segmentation pattern. These gradients provide the interior of the embryo with a basic amount of positional
information, each point in the syncytium now having its own unique chemical signature defined by the relative amounts of the various maternal-effect
gene products. This positional information is made more precise by expression of the gap genes. Three of the anterior–posterior gradient proteins—
Bicoid, Hunchback, and Caudal—are transcription activators that target the
gap genes in the nuclei that now line the inside of the embryo (see Figure
14.32). The identities of the gap genes expressed in a particular nucleus
depend on the relative concentrations of the gradient proteins and hence on
the position of the nucleus along the anterior–posterior axis. Some gap genes
are activated directly by Bicoid, Hunchback, and Caudal, examples being buttonhead, empty spiracles, and orthodenticle which are activated by Bicoid.
Other gap genes are switched on indirectly, as is the case with huckebein and
tailless, which respond to transcription activators that are switched on by
Torso. There are also repressive effects (e.g., Bicoid represses expression of

knirps) and the gap gene products regulate their own expression in various
ways. This complex interplay results in the positional information in the
embryo, now carried by the relative concentrations of the gap gene products,
becoming more detailed (Figure 14.35).
The next set of genes to be activated, the pair-rule genes, establish the basic
segmentation pattern. Transcription of these genes responds to the relative
concentrations of the gap gene products and occurs in nuclei that have
become enclosed in cells. The pair-rule gene products therefore do not diffuse
through the syncytium but remain localized within the cells that express them.
The result is that the embryo can now be looked upon as comprising a series
of stripes, each stripe consisting of a set of cells expressing a particular pairrule gene. In a further round of gene activation, the segment polarity genes
become switched on, providing greater definition to the stripes by setting the
sizes and precise locations of what will eventually be the segments of the larval fly. Gradually we have converted the imprecise positional information of
the maternal-effect gradients into a sharply defined segmentation pattern.

Segment identity is determined by the homeotic selector genes
The pair-rule and segment polarity genes establish the segmentation pattern
of the embryo but do not determine the identities of the individual segments. This is the job of the homeotic selector genes, which were first discovered by virtue of the extravagant effects that mutations in these genes
have on the appearance of the adult fly. The antennapedia mutation, for
example, transforms the head segment that usually produces an antenna
into one that makes a leg, so the mutant fly has a pair of legs where its antennae should be. The early geneticists were fascinated by these monstrous
homeotic mutants and many were collected during the first few decades of
the twentieth century.
Genetic mapping of homeotic mutations has revealed that the selector genes
are clustered in two groups on chromosome 3. These clusters are called the
Antennapedia complex (ANT-C), which contains genes involved in determination of the head and thorax segments, and the Bithorax complex (BX-C),
which contains genes for the abdomen segments (Figure 14.36). Some additional non-selector development genes, such as bicoid, are also located in

Genomes Chapter 14

6/4/06

3:52 pm

Page 455

Regulation of Genome Activity During Development

ANT-C. One interesting feature of the ANT-C and BX-C clusters, which is still
not understood, is that the order of genes corresponds to the order of the segments in the fly, the first gene in ANT-C being labial palps, which controls the
most anterior segment of the fly, and the last gene in BX-C being Abdominal
B, which specifies the most posterior segment.
The correct selector gene is expressed in each segment because the activation
of each one is responsive to the positional information represented by the
distributions of the gap gene and pair-rule gene products. The selector gene
products are themselves transcription activators, each containing a homeodomain version of the helix–turn–helix DNA-binding structure (Section
11.1.1). Each selector gene product, possibly in conjunction with a coactivator such as Extradenticle, switches on the set of genes needed to initiate
development of the specified segment. Maintenance of the differentiated
state is ensured partly by the repressive effect that each selector gene product
has on expression of the other selector genes, and partly by the work of
Polycomb which, as we saw in Section 14.2.2, constructs inactive chromatin
over the selector genes that are not expressed in a particular cell.

Homeotic selector genes are universal features of higher eukaryotic
development
The homeodomains of the various Drosophila selector genes are strikingly
similar. This observation led researchers in the 1980s to search for other
homeotic genes by using the homeodomain as a probe in hybridization experiments. First, the Drosophila genome was searched, resulting in isolation of
several previously unknown homeodomain-containing genes. These have
turned out not to be selector genes but other types of genes coding for transcription activators involved in development. Examples include the pair-rule
genes even-skipped and fushi tarazu, and the segment polarity gene engrailed.
The real excitement came when the genomes of other organisms were
probed and it was realized that homeodomains are present in genes in a wide
variety of animals, including humans. Even more unexpected was the discovery that some of the homeodomain genes in these other organisms are
homeotic selector genes organized into clusters similar to ANT-C and BX-C,
and that these genes have equivalent functions to the Drosophila versions,
specifying construction of the body plan. For example, mutations in the
HoxC8 gene of mouse results in an animal that has an extra pair of ribs, due
to conversion of a lumbar vertebra (normally in the lower back) into a thoracic vertebra (from which the ribs emerge). Other Hox mutations in animals
lead to limb deformations, such as absence of the lower arm, or extra digits
on the hands or feet.
We now look on the ANT-C and BX-C clusters of selector genes in Drosophila
as two parts of a single complex, usually referred to as the homeotic gene
complex, or HOM-C. In vertebrates there are four homeotic gene clusters,
called HoxA to HoxD. When these four clusters are aligned with one another
and with HOM-C (Figure 14.37), similarities are seen between the genes at
equivalent positions, such that the evolutionary history of the homeotic
selector gene clusters can be traced from insects through to humans (see
Section 18.2.1). As in Drosophila, the order of genes in the vertebrate clusters
reflects the order of the structures specified by the genes in the adult body

plan. This is clearly seen with the mouse HoxB cluster, which controls development of the nervous system (Figure 14.38). The remarkable conclusion is
that, at this fundamental level, developmental processes in fruit flies and
other “simple” eukaryotes are similar to the processes occurring in humans
and other “complex” organisms. The discovery that studies of fruit flies are
directly relevant to human development opens up vast vistas of future
research possibilities.

Homeotic genes also underlie plant development
The power of Drosophila as a model system for development extends even
beyond vertebrates. Developmental processes in plants are, in most respects,
very different from those of fruit flies and other animals, but at the genetic
level there are certain similarities, sufficient for the knowledge gained about
Drosophila development to be of value in interpreting similar research carried out with plants. In particular, the recognition that a limited number of
homeotic selector genes control the Drosophila body plan has led to a model
for plant development which postulates that the structure of the flower is
determined by a small number of homeotic genes.
All flowers are constructed along similar lines, made up of four concentric
whorls, each comprising a different floral organ (Figure 14.39). The outer
whorl, number 1, contains sepals, which are modified leaves that envelop and
protect the bud during its early development. The next whorl, number 2, contains the distinctive petals, and within these are whorls 3 (stamens, the male
reproductive organs) and 4 (carpels, the female reproductive organs).
Most of the research on plant development has been carried out with
Antirrhinum (the snapdragon) and Arabidopsis thaliana, a small vetch that

Summary

has been adopted as a model species, partly because it has a genome of only
125 Mb (see Table 7.2), one of the smallest known among flowering plants.
Although these plants do not appear to contain homeodomain proteins, they
do have genes which, when mutated, lead to homeotic changes in the floral
architecture, such as replacement of sepals by carpels. Analysis of these
mutants has led to the “ABC model,” which states that there are three types of
homeotic genes—A, B, and C—which control flower development as follows:
G

Whorl 1 is specified by A-type genes: examples in Arabidopsis are apetala1
and apetala2.

G

Whorl 2 is specified by A genes acting in concert with B genes, examples
of the latter including apetala3 and pistillata.

G

Whorl 3 is specified by the B genes plus the C gene, agamous.

G

Whorl 4 is specified by the C gene acting on its own.

As anticipated from the work with Drosophila, the A, B, and C homeotic gene
products are transcription activators. All except the APETALA2 protein contain the same DNA-binding domain, the MADS box, which is also found in
other proteins involved in plant development, including SEPALLATA1, 2, and
3, which work with the A, B, and C proteins in defining the detailed structure
of the flower. Other components of the flower development system include at
least one master gene, called floricaula in Antirrhinum and leafy in
Arabidopsis, which controls the switch from vegetative to reproductive
growth, initiating flower development, and also has a role in establishing the
pattern of homeotic gene expression. In Arabidopsis there is also a gene,
called curly leaf, whose product acts like Polycomb of Drosophila (Section
14.2.2), maintaining the differentiated state of each cell by repressing those
homeotic genes that are inactive in a particular whorl.

Summary
There are many steps within the expression pathways of individual genes at
which regulation can be exerted, but the key control mechanisms act during
the initiation of transcription. Transient changes in genome expression patterns occur predominantly in response to external stimuli which influence
the transcription of individual genes. Some extracellular signaling compounds are imported into the cell and directly influence transcription, an
example being lactoferrin in mammals. Steroid hormones also enter the cell
but influence genome expression via receptor proteins which act as transcription activators. In catabolite repression in bacteria, glucose influences
expression of a variety of genes involved in sugar utilization by indirectly controlling the level of cyclic AMP in the cell, which in turn influences the activity of a transcription activator called the catabolite activator protein. Other
signaling pathways are mediated by cell surface receptors, many of which
dimerize in response to the extracellular signal, initiating a signal transduction pathway that leads to the genome. The MAP kinase pathway is one such
example, but there are several others, including ones involving transcription
activators called STATs. Some signal transduction pathways make use of second messengers such as cyclic nucleotides and calcium ions, which influence
a number of cellular activities including genome expression. Permanent and
semipermanent changes in genome expression can be brought about by
genome rearrangements, as occur during mating-type switching in yeast and

generation of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor diversity in vertebrates.
Permanent and semipermanent changes can also be produced by proteins
such as Polycomb of Drosophila melanogaster, which induces the formation
of heterochromatin over regions of a chromosome that must be silenced. Our
understanding of the genetic basis of development has been aided by the
study of model systems in relatively simple organisms such as bacteria,
Caenorhabditis elegans, and Drosphila melanogaster. The lysogenic infection
cycle of bacteriophage l indicates ways in which simple genetic switches can
determine which of two developmental pathways are followed, and studies of
sporulation in Bacillus subtilis have illustrated how time-dependent changes
in genome expression can be brought about and how cell–cell signaling can
regulate a differentiation pathway. Mechanisms for the determination of cell
fate have been revealed by studies of vulva development in C. elegans. The
most informative pathway for developmental genetics has been embryogenesis in the fruit fly, study of which has shown how a complex body plan can
be specified by controlled patterns of genome expression. This work has also
revealed the existence of homeotic selector genes which control development
processes not only in flies, but also in vertebrates and in plants.

Part 4 – How Genomes Replicate and Evolve links
replication, mutation and recombination with the
gradual evolution of genomes over time. We begin
with a detailed examination of the molecular
processes underlying genome replication
(Chapter 15), mutation and repair (Chapter 16),
and recombination (Chapter 17) before exploring
the ways in which these processes have shaped
the structures and genetic contents of genomes
over evolutionary time (Chapter 18). Finally,
Chapter 19 describes how molecular phylogenetics makes use of the evolutionary information
contained within genomes to investigate questions such as the relationships between humans
and other primates, the origins of AIDS, and the
migratory routes followed by humans as we spread
across the planet from our birthplace in Africa.

Genome Replication

When you have read Chapter 15, you should be able to:
State what is meant by the topological problem and explain how DNA topoisomerases solve
this problem.
Describe the key experiment that proved that DNA replication occurs by the semiconservative
process.
Outline the displacement and rolling circle modes of genome replication.
Discuss how replication is initiated in bacteria, yeast, and mammals.
Describe the key features of bacterial and eukaryotic DNA polymerases.
Explain why the leading and lagging strands of a DNA molecule must be replicated by different
processes.
Give a detailed description of the events occurring at the bacterial replication fork, and indicate
how these events differ from those occurring in eukaryotes.
Describe what is currently known about termination of replication in bacteria and eukaryotes.
Explain how telomerase maintains the ends of a chromosomal DNA molecule in eukaryotes, and
appraise the possible links between telomere length, cell senescence, and cancer.
Describe how genome replication is coordinated with the cell cycle.

The primary function of a genome is to specify the biochemical signature of
the cell in which it resides. We have seen that the genome achieves this objective by the coordinated expression of genes and groups of genes, resulting in
maintenance of a proteome whose individual protein components carry out
and regulate the cell’s biochemical activities. In order to continue carrying
out this function, the genome must replicate every time that the cell divides.
This means that the entire DNA content of the cell must be copied at the
appropriate period in the cell cycle, and the resulting DNA molecules must be

molecular biology, biochemistry, and cell biology, is described in this chapter.

Genome replication has been studied since Watson and Crick first discovered
the double helix structure of DNA back in 1953. In the years since then,
research has been driven by three related but distinct issues:

C G
T A
G C
A T

G

The topological problem was the primary concern in the years from 1953
to 1958. This problem arises from the need to unwind the double helix in
order to make copies of its two polynucleotides (see Figure 15.1). The issue
assumed center stage in the mid-1950s because it was the main stumbling
block to acceptance of the double helix as the correct structure for DNA,
but moved into the background in 1958 when Matthew Meselson and
Franklin Stahl demonstrated that, despite the perceived difficulties, DNA
replication in Escherichia coli occurs by the method predicted by the double helix structure. The Meselson–Stahl experiment enabled research into
genome replication to move forward, even though the topological problem itself was not solved until the early 1980s when the mode of action of
DNA topoisomerases was first understood (Section 15.1.2).

G

The replication process has been studied intensively since 1958. During
the 1960s, the enzymes and proteins involved in replication in E. coli were
identified and their functions delineated, and in the following years similar progress was made in understanding the details of eukaryotic genome
replication. This work is ongoing, with research today centered on topics
such as the initiation of replication and the precise modes of action of the
proteins that are active at the replication fork.

G

The regulation of genome replication, particularly in the context of the
cell cycle, has become the predominant area of research in recent years.
This work has shown that initiation is the key control point in genome
replication and has begun to explain how replication is synchronized with
the cell cycle so that daughter genomes are available when the cell divides.

Two daughter double helices

Figure 15.1 DNA replication, as predicted
by Watson and Crick. The polynucleotides
of the parent double helix are shown in
black. Both act as templates for synthesis of
new strands of DNA, shown in red. The
sequences of these new strands are
determined by base pairing with the
template molecules. The topological
problem arises because the two
polynucleotides of the parent helix cannot
simply be pulled apart; the helix has to be
unwound in some way.

Our study of genome replication will deal with each of these three topics in
the order listed above.

15.1 The Topological Problem
In their paper in Nature announcing the discovery of the double helix structure of DNA, Watson and Crick made one of the most famous statements in
molecular biology:
“It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated
immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material.”
The pairing process that they refer to is one in which each strand of the double helix acts as a template for synthesis of a second complementary strand,
the end result being that both of the daughter double helices are identical to
the parent molecule (Figure 15.1). The scheme is almost implicit in the double helix structure, but it presents problems, as admitted by Watson and Crick
in a second paper published in Nature just a month after the report of the
structure. This paper describes the postulated replication process in more
detail, but points out the difficulties that arise from the need to unwind the

The Topological Problem

double helix. The most trivial of these difficulties is the possibility of the
daughter molecules getting tangled up. More critical is the rotation that
would accompany the unwinding: with one turn occurring for every 10 bp of
the double helix, complete replication of the DNA molecule in human chromosome 1, which is 250 Mb in length, would require 25 million rotations of
the chromosomal DNA. It is difficult to imagine how this could occur within
the constrained volume of the nucleus, but the unwinding of a linear chromosomal DNA molecule is not physically impossible. In contrast, a circular
double-stranded molecule, for example a bacterial or bacteriophage genome,
having no free ends, would not be able to rotate in the required manner and
so, apparently, could not be replicated by the Watson–Crick scheme. Finding
an answer to this dilemma was a major preoccupation of molecular biology
during the 1950s.

15.1.1 Experimental proof for the Watson–Crick scheme for
DNA replication
The topological problem was considered so serious by some molecular biologists, notably Max Delbrück, that there was initially some resistance to
accepting the double helix as the correct structure of DNA. The difficulty
relates to the plectonemic nature of the double helix, this being the topological arrangement that prevents the two strands of a coil being separated without unwinding. The problem would therefore be resolved if the double helix
was in fact paranemic, because this would mean that the two strands could
be separated simply by moving each one sideways without unwinding the
molecule. It was suggested that the double helix could be converted into a
paranemic structure by supercoiling in the direction opposite to the turn of
the helix itself, or that within a DNA molecule the right-handed helix proposed by Watson and Crick might be “balanced” by equal lengths of a lefthanded helical structure. The possibility that double-stranded DNA was not a
helix at all, but a side-by-side ribbon structure, was also briefly considered,
this idea surprisingly being revived in the late 1970s. Each of these proposed
solutions to the topological problem were individually rejected for one reason or another, most of them because they required alterations to the double
helix structure, alterations that were not compatible with the X-ray diffraction
results and other experimental data pertaining to DNA structure.
The first real progress toward a solution of the topological problem came in
1954 when Delbrück proposed a “breakage-and-reunion” model for separating
the strands of the double helix. In this model, the strands are separated not by
unwinding the helix with accompanying rotation of the molecule, but by
breaking one of the strands, passing the second strand though the gap, and
rejoining the first strand. This scheme is in fact very close to the correct solution to the topological problem, being one of the ways in which DNA topoisomerases work (see Figure 15.4A), but unfortunately Delbrück overcomplicated
the issue by attempting to combine breakage and reunion with the DNA synthesis that occurs during the actual replication process. This led him to a
model for DNA replication which results in each polynucleotide in the daughter molecule being made up partly of parental DNA and partly of newly synthesized DNA (Figure 15.2A). This dispersive mode of replication contrasts with
the semiconservative system proposed by Watson and Crick (Figure 15.2B). A
third possibility is that replication is fully conservative, one of the daughter
double helices being made entirely of newly synthesized DNA and the other
comprising the two parental strands (Figure 15.2C). Models for conservative

replication are difficult to devise, but one can imagine that this type of replication might be accomplished without unwinding the parent helix.

The Meselson–Stahl experiment
Delbrück’s breakage-and-reunion model was important because it stimulated experiments designed to test between the three modes of DNA replication illustrated in Figure 15.2. Radioactive isotopes had recently been introduced into molecular biology, so attempts were made to use DNA labeling
(see Technical Note 2.1) to distinguish newly synthesized DNA from the
parental polynucleotides. Each mode of replication predicts a different distribution of newly synthesized DNA, and hence of radioactive label, in the double helices resulting after two or more rounds of replication. Analysis of the
radioactive contents of these molecules should therefore determine which
replication scheme operates in living cells. Unfortunately, it proved impossible to obtain a clear-cut result, largely because of the difficulty in measuring
the precise amount of radioactivity in the DNA molecules, the analysis being
complicated by the rapid decay of the 32P isotope that was used as the label.
The breakthrough was eventually made by Matthew Meselson and Franklin
Stahl who, in 1958, carried out the required experiment not with a radioactive label but with 15N, the nonradioactive “heavy” isotope of nitrogen. Now
it was possible to analyze the replicated double helices by density gradient
centrifugation (see Technical Note 7.1), because a DNA molecule labeled
with 15N has a higher buoyant density than an unlabeled molecule. Meselson
and Stahl started with a culture of E. coli cells that had been grown with
15NH Cl and whose DNA molecules therefore contained heavy nitrogen. The
4
cells were transferred to normal medium, and samples taken after 20 minutes and 40 minutes, corresponding to one and two cell divisions, respectively. DNA was extracted from each sample and the molecules examined by
density gradient centrifugation (Figure 15.3A). After one round of DNA replication, the daughter molecules synthesized in the presence of normal nitrogen formed a single band in the density gradient, indicating that each double helix was made up of equal amounts of newly synthesized and parental

DNA. This result immediately enabled the conservative mode of replication
to be discounted, as this predicts that there would be two bands after one
round of replication (Figure 15.3B), but did not provide a distinction between
Delbrück’s dispersive model and the semiconservative process favored by
Watson and Crick. The distinction was, however, possible when the DNA molecules resulting from two rounds of replication were examined. Now the density gradient revealed two bands of DNA, the first corresponding to a hybrid

Cells were then transferred to normal

taken after 20 minutes (one cell division)
and 40 minutes (two cell divisions). DNA
was extracted from each sample and the
molecules analyzed by density gradient
centrifugation. After 20 minutes, all the DNA
contained similar amounts of 14N and 15N,
but after 40 minutes two bands were seen,
one corresponding to hybrid 14N–15N–DNA,
and the other to DNA molecules made
entirely using 14N. (B) The predicted
outcome of the experiment is shown for
each of the three possible modes of DNA
replication. The banding pattern seen after
20 minutes enables conservative replication
to be discounted because this scheme
predicts that after one round of replication
there will be two different types of double
helix, one containing just 15N and the other
containing just 14N. The single
14N–15N–DNA band that was actually seen
after 20 minutes is compatible with both
dispersive and semiconservative replication,
but the two bands seen after 40 minutes
are consistent only with semiconservative
replication. Dispersive replication continues
to give hybrid 14N–15N molecules after two
rounds of replication, whereas the
granddaughter molecules produced at this
stage by semiconservative replication
include two that are made entirely of
14N–DNA.

composed of equal parts of newly synthesized and old DNA, and the second
corresponding to molecules made up entirely of new DNA. This result agrees
with the semiconservative scheme but is incompatible with dispersive replication, the latter predicting that after two rounds of replication all molecules
would be hybrids.

15.1.2 DNA topoisomerases provide a solution to the
topological problem

Figure 15.4 The mode of action of a Type
I DNA topoisomerase. A Type I
topoisomerase makes a nick in one strand
of a DNA molecule, passes the intact strand
through the nick, and reseals the gap.

The Meselson–Stahl experiment proved that DNA replication in living cells
follows the semiconservative scheme proposed by Watson and Crick, and
hence indicated that the cell must have a solution to the topological problem.
This solution was not understood by molecular biologists until some 25 years
later, when the activities of the enzymes called DNA topoisomerases were
characterized.
DNA topoisomerases are enzymes that carry out breakage-and-reunion reactions similar but not identical to that envisaged by Delbrück. Two types of
DNA topoisomerase are recognized (Table 15.1):
G

Type I topoisomerases introduce a break in one polynucleotide and pass
the second polynucleotide through the gap that is formed (Figure 15.4).
The two ends of the broken strand are then religated. This mode of action
results in the linking number (the number of times one strand crosses the
other in a circular molecule) being changed by one.

G

Type II topoisomerases break both strands of the double helix, creating a
“gate” through which a second segment of the helix is passed. This changes
the linking number by two.

Breaking one or both DNA strands might appear to be a drastic solution to the
topological problem, leading to the possibility that the topoisomerase might
occasionally fail to rejoin a strand and hence inadvertently break a chromosome into two sections. This possibility is reduced by the mode of action of
these enzymes. One end of each cut polynucleotide becomes covalently
attached to a tyrosine amino acid at the active site of the enzyme, ensuring
that this end of the polynucleotide is held tightly in place while the free end(s)
is being manipulated. Type I and II topoisomerases are subdivided according
to the precise chemical structure of the polynucleotide–tyrosine linkage: with
IA and IIA enzymes the link involves a phosphate group attached to the free
5¢ end of the cut polynucleotide, and with IB and IIB enzymes the linkage is
via a 3¢ phosphate group. The A and B topoisomerases probably evolved separately. Both types are present in eukaryotes but IB and IIB enzymes are very
uncommon in prokaryotes.
Note that DNA topoisomerases do not themselves unwind the double helix.
Instead they solve the topological problem by counteracting the overwinding

During replication, the double helix is
“unzipped” as a result of the action of DNA
topoisomerases. The replication fork is
therefore able to proceed along the
molecule without the helix having to rotate.

that otherwise would be introduced into the molecule by the progression of
the replication fork. The result is that the helix can be “unzipped,” with the
two strands pulled apart sideways without the molecule having to rotate
(Figure 15.5). Replication is not the only activity that is complicated by the
topology of the double helix, and it is becoming increasingly clear that DNA
topoisomerases have equally important roles during transcription, recombination, and other processes that can result in over- or underwinding of DNA.
In eukaryotes, topoisomerases form a major part of the nuclear matrix, the
scaffold-like network that permeates the nucleus (Section 10.1.1), and are
responsible for maintaining chromatin structure and unlinking DNA molecules during chromosome division. Most topoisomerases are only able to
relax DNA, but some prokaryotic enzymes, such as the bacterial DNA gyrase
and the archaeal reverse gyrase, can carry out the reverse reaction and introduce supercoils into DNA molecules.

15.1.3 Variations on the semiconservative theme
No exceptions to the semiconservative mode of DNA replication are known
but there are several variations on this basic theme. DNA copying via a replication fork, as shown in Figure 15.1, is the predominant system, being used
by chromosomal DNA molecules in eukaryotes and by the circular genomes
of prokaryotes. Some smaller circular molecules, such as animal mitochondrial genomes (Section 8.3.2), use a slightly different process called displacement replication. In these molecules, the point at which replication begins is
marked by a D-loop, a region of approximately 500 bp where the double helix
is disrupted by the presence of an RNA molecule base-paired to one of the
DNA strands (Figure 15.6). This RNA molecule acts as the starting point for
synthesis of one of the daughter polynucleotides. This polynucleotide is synthesized by continuous copying of one strand of the helix, the second strand
being displaced and subsequently copied after synthesis of the first daughter
genome has been completed.
The advantage of displacement replication as performed by animal mitochondrial DNA is not clear. In contrast, the special type of displacement

The D-loop contains a short RNA molecule
that primes DNA synthesis (see Section
15.2.2). After completion of the first strand

the displaced strand and initiates replication
of this molecule. In this diagram, newly
synthesized DNA is shown in red.

process called rolling circle replication is an efficient mechanism for the
rapid synthesis of multiple copies of a circular genome. Rolling circle replication, which is used by l and various other bacteriophages, initiates at a nick
which is made in one of the parent polynucleotides. The free 3¢ end that
results is extended, displacing the 5¢ end of the polynucleotide. Continued
DNA synthesis “rolls off” a complete copy of the genome, and further synthesis eventually results in a series of genomes linked head to tail (Figure 15.7).
These genomes are single stranded and linear, but can easily be converted to
double-stranded circular molecules by complementary strand synthesis, followed by cleavage at the junction points between genomes, and circularization of the resulting segments.

The Replication Process

475

15.2 The Replication Process
As with many processes in molecular biology, we conventionally look on
genome replication as being made up of three phases—initiation, elongation,
and termination:
G

Initiation (Section 15.2.1) involves recognition of the position(s) on a DNA
molecule where replication will begin.

G

Elongation (Section 15.2.2) concerns the events occurring at the replication fork, where the parent polynucleotides are copied.

G

Termination (Section 15.2.3), which in general is only vaguely understood,
occurs when the parent molecule has been completely replicated.

As well as these three stages in replication, one additional topic demands
attention. This relates to a limitation in the replication process that, if uncorrected, would lead to linear double-stranded DNA molecules getting shorter
each time they are copied. The solution to this problem, which concerns the
structure and synthesis of the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes (Section
7.1.2), is described in Section 15.2.4.

15.2.1 Initiation of genome replication
Initiation of replication is not a random process and always begins at the
same position or positions on a DNA molecule, these points being called the
origins of replication. Once initiated, two replication forks can emerge from
the origin and progress in opposite directions along the DNA: replication is
therefore bidirectional with most genomes (Figure 15.8). A circular bacterial
genome has a single origin of replication, meaning that several thousand
kilobases of DNA are copied by each replication fork. This situation differs
from that seen with eukaryotic chromosomes, which have multiple origins
and whose replication forks progress for shorter distances. The yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae, for example, has about 332 origins, corresponding
to 1 per 36 kb of DNA, and humans have some 20,000 origins, or 1 for every
150 kb of DNA.

(A) Replication of a circular bacterial chromosome

Initiation at the E. coli origin of replication
We know substantially more about initiation of replication in bacteria than
in eukaryotes. The E. coli origin of replication is referred to as oriC. By transferring segments of DNA from the oriC region into plasmids that lack their
own origins, it has been estimated that the E. coli origin of replication spans
approximately 245 bp of DNA. Sequence analysis of this segment shows that
it contains two short repeat motifs, one of nine nucleotides and the other of
13 nucleotides (Figure 15.9A). The nine-nucleotide repeat, five copies of
which are dispersed throughout oriC, is the binding site for a protein called
DnaA. With five copies of the binding sequence, it might be imagined that five
copies of DnaA attach to the origin, but in fact bound DnaA proteins cooperate with unbound molecules until some 30 copies are associated with the origin. Attachment occurs only when the DNA is negatively supercoiled, as is the
normal situation for the E. coli chromosome (Section 8.1.1).
The result of DnaA binding is that the double helix opens up (“melts”) within
the tandem array of three AT-rich, 13-nucleotide repeats located at one end of
the oriC sequence (Figure 15.9B). The exact mechanism is unknown but
DnaA does not appear to possess the enzymatic activity needed to break base
pairs, and it is therefore assumed that the helix is melted by torsional stresses

Figure 15.9 The Escherichia coli origin of
replication. (A) The E. coli origin of
replication is called oriC and is
approximately 245 bp in length. It contains
three copies of a 13-nucleotide repeat
motif, consensus sequence
5¢–GATCTNTTNTTTT–3¢ where “N” is any
nucleotide, and five copies of a ninenucleotide repeat, consensus
5¢–TT(A/T)T(A/C)CA(A/C)A–3¢, where
(A/T) is A or T, and (A/C) is A or C. The 13nucleotide sequences form a tandem array
of direct repeats at one end of oriC. The
nine-nucleotide sequences are distributed
through oriC, three units forming a series of
direct repeats and two units in the inverted
configuration, as indicated by the arrows.
Three of the nine-nucleotide repeats—
numbers 1, 3, and 5 when counted from
the left-hand end of oriC as drawn here—
are regarded as major sites for DnaA
attachment; the other two repeats are minor
sites. The overall structure of the origin is
similar in all bacteria and the sequences of
the repeats do not vary greatly. (B) Model

introduced by attachment of the DnaA proteins. An attractive model imagines that the DnaA proteins form a barrel-like structure around which the
helix is wound. Melting the helix is promoted by HU, the most abundant of
the DNA packaging proteins of E. coli (Section 8.1.1).
Melting of the helix initiates a series of events that construct a nascent replication fork at either end of the open region. The first step is the attachment of
a prepriming complex at each of these two positions. Each prepriming complex initially comprises 12 proteins, six copies of DnaB and six copies of
DnaC, but DnaC has a transitory role and is released from the complex soon
after it is formed, its function probably being simply to aid the attachment of
DnaB. The latter is a helicase, an enzyme which can break base pairs (see
Section 15.2.2). DnaB begins to increase the single-stranded region within the
origin, enabling the enzymes involved in the elongation phase of genome
replication to attach. This represents the end of the initiation phase of replication in E. coli as the replication forks now start to progress away from the
origin and DNA copying begins.

Origins of replication in yeast have been clearly defined
The technique used to delineate the E. coli oriC sequence, involving transfer
of DNA segments into a nonreplicating plasmid, has also proved valuable in
identifying origins of replication in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
Origins identified in this way are called autonomously replicating
sequences, or ARSs. A typical yeast origin is shorter than E. coli oriC, being
usually less than 200 bp in length, but, like the E. coli origin, contains discrete
segments with different functional roles, these “subdomains” having similar
sequences in different origins (Figure 15.10A). Four subdomains are recognized. Two of these—subdomains A and B1—make up the origin recognition
sequence, a stretch of some 40 bp in total that is the binding site for the origin recognition complex (ORC), a set of six proteins that attach to the origin
(Figure 15.10B). ORCs have been described as yeast versions of the E. coli
DnaA proteins, but this interpretation is probably not strictly correct because
ORCs appear to remain attached to yeast origins throughout the cell cycle.
Rather than being genuine initiator proteins, it is more likely that ORCs are
involved in the regulation of genome replication, acting as mediators

Genomes Chapter 15

The Replication Process

between replication origins and the regulatory signals that coordinate the initiation of DNA replication with the cell cycle (Section 15.3.1).
We must therefore look elsewhere in yeast origins for sequences with functions strictly equivalent to that of oriC of E. coli. This leads us to the two other
conserved sequences in the typical yeast origin, subdomains B2 and B3 (see
Figure 15.10A). Our current understanding suggests that these two subdomains function in a manner similar to the E. coli origin. Subdomain B2
appears to correspond to the 13-nucleotide repeat array of the E. coli origin,
being the position at which the two strands of the helix are first separated.
This melting is induced by torsional stress introduced by attachment of a
DNA-binding protein, ARS binding factor 1 (ABF1), which attaches to subdomain B3 (see Figure 15.10B). As in E. coli, melting of the helix within a yeast
replication origin is followed by attachment of the helicase and other replication enzymes to the DNA, completing the initiation process and enabling the
replication forks to begin their progress along the DNA, as described in
Section 15.2.2.

Replication origins in higher eukaryotes have been less easy
to identify
Attempts to identify replication origins in humans and other higher eukaryotes have, until recently, been less successful. Initiation regions (parts of the
chromosomal DNA where replication initiates) can be delineated by various
biochemical methods, for example by allowing replication to initiate in the
presence of labeled nucleotides, then arresting the process, purifying the
newly synthesized DNA, and determining the positions of these nascent
strands in the genome. These experiments have suggested that there are specific regions in mammalian chromosomes where replication begins, but
some researchers have been doubtful whether these regions contain replication origins equivalent to those in yeast. One alternative hypothesis is that
replication is initiated by protein structures that have specific positions in the
nucleus, the chromosome initiation regions simply being those DNA segments located close to these protein structures in the three-dimensional
organization of the nucleus.
Doubts about mammalian replication origins were increased by the failure of
mammalian initiation regions to confer replicative ability on replication-deficient plasmids, although these experiments were not considered conclusive
because it was recognized that a mammalian origin might be too long to be
cloned in a plasmid or might function only when activated by distant sites in
the chromosomal DNA. A key breakthrough has been the demonstration that
an 8 kb segment of a human initiation region, when transferred to the monkey genome, still directs replication despite being removed from any hypothetical protein structure in the human nucleus. Analysis of this transferred
initiation region has shown that there are primary sites within the region
where initiation occurs at high frequency, surrounded by secondary sites,
spanning the entire 8 kb region, at which replication initiates with lower frequency. The presence of discrete functional domains within the initiation
region has also been demonstrated by examining the effects of deletions of
parts of the region on the efficiency of replication initiation.
The demonstration that the human genome does in fact contain replication
origins equivalent to those in yeast raises the question of whether mammals

possess an equivalent of the yeast ORC. The answer appears to be yes, as several genes whose protein products have similar sequences to the yeast ORC
proteins have been identified in higher eukaryotes, and some of these proteins
have been shown to be able to replace the equivalent yeast protein in the yeast
ORC. These results indicate that initiation of replication in yeast is a good
model for events occurring in mammals, a conclusion that is very relevant to
studies of the control of replication initiation, as we will see in Section 15.3.

15.2.2 The elongation phase of replication
Once replication has been initiated, the replication forks progress along the
DNA and participate in the central activity of genome replication—the synthesis of new strands of DNA that are complementary to the parent polynucleotides. At the chemical level, the template-dependent synthesis of DNA
(Figure 15.11) is very similar to the template-dependent synthesis of RNA
that occurs during transcription (compare with Figure 12.1). However, this
similarity should not mislead us into making an extensive analogy between

transcription and replication. The mechanics of the two processes are quite
different, replication being complicated by two factors that do not apply to
transcription:
G

G

During DNA replication both strands of the double helix must be copied.
This is an important complication because, as noted in Section 1.1.2, DNA
polymerase enzymes are only able to synthesize DNA in the 5¢Æ3¢ direction. This means that one strand of the parent double helix, called the
leading strand, can be copied in a continuous manner, but replication of
the lagging strand has to be carried out in a discontinuous fashion, resulting in a series of short segments that must be ligated together to produce
the intact daughter strand (Figure 15.12).
The second complication arises because template-dependent DNA polymerases cannot initiate DNA synthesis on a molecule that is entirely single stranded: there must be a short double-stranded region to provide a 3¢
end onto which the enzyme can add new nucleotides. This means that
primers are needed, one to initiate complementary strand synthesis on
the leading polynucleotide, and one for every segment of discontinuous
DNA synthesized on the lagging strand (Figure 15.12).

Before dealing with these two complications we will first examine the DNA
polymerase enzymes themselves.

The DNA polymerases of bacteria and eukaryotes
The principal chemical reaction catalyzed by a DNA polymerase is the 5¢Æ3¢
synthesis of a DNA polynucleotide, as shown in Figure 15.11. We learnt in
Section 2.1.1 that some DNA polymerases combine this function with at least
one exonuclease activity, which means that these enzymes can degrade polynucleotides as well as synthesize them (see Figure 2.7):
G

A 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity is possessed by many bacterial and eukaryotic template-dependent DNA polymerases (Table 15.2). This activity
enables the enzyme to remove nucleotides from the 3¢ end of the strand
that it has just synthesized. It is looked on as a proofreading activity
whose function is to correct the occasional base-pairing error that might
occur during strand synthesis (see Section 16.1.1).

G

A 5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease activity is less common but is possessed by some
polymerases whose function in replication requires that they must be able
to remove at least part of a polynucleotide that is already attached to the
template strand that the polymerase is copying. This activity is utilized
during the process that joins together the discontinuous DNA fragments
synthesized on the lagging strand during bacterial DNA replication (see
Figure 15.18).

The search for DNA polymerases began in the mid-1950s, as soon as it was
realized that DNA synthesis was the key to replication of genes. It was
thought that bacteria would probably have just a single DNA polymerase,
and when the enzyme now called DNA polymerase I was isolated by Arthur
Kornberg in 1957 there was a widespread assumption that this was the main
replicating enzyme. The discovery that inactivation of the E. coli polA gene,
which codes for DNA polymerase I, was not lethal (cells were still able to
replicate their genomes) therefore came as something of a surprise, especially when a similar result was obtained with inactivation of polB, coding for
a second enzyme, DNA polymerase II, which we now know is mainly

replication. Two complications have to be
solved when double-stranded DNA is
replicated. First, only the leading strand can
be continuously replicated by 5¢Æ3¢ DNA
synthesis; replication of the lagging strand
has to be carried out discontinuously.
Second, initiation of DNA synthesis requires
a primer. This is true both of cellular DNA
synthesis, as shown here, and DNA
synthesis reactions that are carried out in
the test tube (Section 2.1.1).

Eukaryotic DNA polymerases

Bacteria and eukaryotes possess other DNA polymerases involved primarily in repair of damaged DNA. These enzymes include DNA polymerases II,
IV, and V of Escherichia coli and the eukaryotic DNA polymerases b, e, z, h, q, and i. DNA repair processes are described in Section 16.2.

involved in repair of damaged DNA rather than genome replication (Section
16.2). It was not until 1972 that the main replicating polymerase of E. coli,
DNA polymerase III, was eventually isolated. Both DNA polymerases I and
III are involved in genome replication, as we will see in the next section.
DNA polymerases I and II are single polypeptides but DNA polymerase III,
befitting its role as the main replicating enzyme, is a multisubunit protein,
with a molecular mass of approximately 900 kDa (Table 15.2). The three main
subunits, which form the core enzyme, are called a, e, and q, with the polymerase activity specified by the a subunit and the 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity
by e. The function of q is not clear: it may have a purely structural role in
bringing together the other two core subunits and in assembling the various
accessory subunits. The latter include t and g, both coded by the same gene,
with g synthesized by translational frameshifting (Section 13.2.3), b, which
acts as a “sliding clamp” and holds the polymerase complex tightly to the
template, and the d, d¢, c, and y subunits.
Eukaryotes have at least nine DNA polymerases, which in mammals are distinguished by Greek suffixes (a, b, g, d, etc.), an unfortunate choice of nomenclature as it tempts confusion with the identically named subunits of E. coli
DNA polymerase III. The main replicating enzyme is DNA polymerase d
(Table 15.2), which has two subunits (three according to some researchers)
and works in conjunction with an accessory protein called the proliferating
cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). PCNA is the functional equivalent of the b subunit of E. coli DNA polymerase III and holds the enzyme tightly to the template. DNA polymerase a also has an important function in DNA synthesis,
being the enzyme that primes eukaryotic replication (see Figure 15.13B).
DNA polymerase g, although coded by a nuclear gene, is responsible for replicating the mitochondrial genome.

The Replication Process

Discontinuous strand synthesis and the priming problem
The limitation that DNA polymerases can synthesize polynucleotides only in
the 5¢Æ3¢ direction means that the lagging strand of the parent molecule
must be copied in a discontinuous fashion, as shown in Figure 15.12. The
implication of this model—that the initial products of lagging-strand replication are short segments of polynucleotide—was confirmed in 1969 when
Okazaki fragments, as these segments are now called, were first isolated from
E. coli. In bacteria, Okazaki fragments are 1000–2000 nucleotides in length,
but in eukaryotes the equivalent fragments appear to be much shorter, perhaps less than 200 nucleotides in length. This is an interesting observation
that might indicate that each round of discontinuous synthesis replicates the
DNA associated with a single nucleosome (between 140 and 150 bp wound
around the core particle plus 50–70 bp of linker DNA; Section 7.1.1).
The second difficulty illustrated in Figure 15.12 is the need for a primer to initiate synthesis of each new polynucleotide. It is not known for certain why
DNA polymerases cannot begin synthesis on an entirely single-stranded template, but it may relate to the proofreading activity of these enzymes, which is
essential for the accuracy of replication. As described in Section 16.1.1, a
nucleotide that has been inserted incorrectly at the extreme 3¢ end of a growing DNA strand, and hence is not base-paired to the template polynucleotide,
can be removed by the 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity of a DNA polymerase. This
means that the 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity must be more effective than the
5¢Æ3¢ polymerase activity when the 3¢ nucleotide is not base-paired to the
template. The implication is that the polymerase can extend a polynucleotide
efficiently only if the 3¢ nucleotide is base-paired, which in turn could be the
reason why an entirely single-stranded template, which by definition lacks a
base-paired 3¢ nucleotide, cannot be used by a DNA polymerase.
Whatever the reason, priming is a necessity in DNA replication but does not
present too much of a problem. Although DNA polymerases cannot deal with
an entirely single-stranded template, RNA polymerases have no difficulty in
this respect, so the primers for DNA replication are made of RNA. In bacteria,
primers are synthesized by primase, a special RNA polymerase unrelated to
the transcribing enzyme, with each primer being 4–15 nucleotides in length
and most starting with the sequence 5¢–AG–3¢. Once the primer has been
completed, strand synthesis is continued by DNA polymerase III (Figure
15.13A). In eukaryotes the situation is slightly more complex because the primase is tightly bound to DNA polymerase a, and cooperates with this enzyme
in synthesis of the first few nucleotides of a new polynucleotide. This primase
synthesizes an RNA primer of 8–12 nucleotides, and then hands over to DNA
polymerase a, which extends the RNA primer by adding about 20 nucleotides
of DNA. This DNA stretch often has a few ribonucleotides mixed in, but it is
not clear if these are incorporated by DNA polymerase a or by intermittent
activity of the primase. After completion of the RNA–DNA primer, DNA synthesis is continued by the main replicative enzyme, DNA polymerase d
(Figure 15.13B).
Priming needs to occur just once on the leading strand, within the replication
origin, because once primed, the leading-strand copy is synthesized continuously until replication is completed. On the lagging strand, priming is a
repeated process that must occur every time a new Okazaki fragment is initiated. In E. coli, which makes Okazaki fragments of 1000–2000 nucleotides in

length, approximately 4000 priming events are needed every time the
genome is replicated. In eukaryotes, the Okazaki fragments are much shorter
and priming is a highly repetitive event.

Events at the bacterial replication fork
Now that we have considered the complications introduced by discontinuous
strand synthesis and the priming problem, we can move on to study the combination of events occurring at the replication fork during the elongation
phase of genome replication.
In Section 15.2.1 we identified attachment of the DnaB helicase, followed by
extension of the melted region of the replication origin, as representing the
end of the initiation phase of replication in E. coli. To a large extent, the division between initiation and elongation is artificial, the two processes running
seamlessly one into the other. After the helicase has bound to the origin to
form the prepriming complex, the primase is recruited, resulting in the primosome, which initiates replication of the leading strand. It does this by synthesizing the RNA primer that DNA polymerase III needs in order to begin
copying the template.
DnaB is the main helicase involved in genome replication in E. coli, but it is
by no means the only helicase that this bacterium possesses: in fact, there

were eleven at the last count. The size of the collection reflects the fact that
DNA unwinding is required not only during replication but also during
diverse processes such as transcription, recombination, and DNA repair. The
mode of action of a typical helicase has not been precisely defined, but it is
thought that these enzymes bind to single-stranded rather than doublestranded DNA, and migrate along the polynucleotide in either the 5¢Æ3¢ or
3¢Æ5¢ direction, depending on the specificity of the helicase. Breakage of base
pairs by the helicase requires energy, which is generated by hydrolysis of ATP.
According to this model, a single DnaB helicase could migrate along the lagging strand (DnaB is a 5¢Æ3¢ helicase), unzipping the helix and generating the
replication fork, the torsional stress generated by the unwinding activity
being relieved by DNA topoisomerase action (Figure 15.14). This model is
probably a good approximation of what actually happens, although it does
not provide a function for the two other E. coli helicases thought to be
involved in genome replication. Both of these, PriA and Rep, are 3¢Æ5¢ helicases and so could conceivably complement DnaB activity by migrating
along the leading strand, but they may have lesser roles. The involvement of
Rep in DNA replication might, in fact, be limited to participation in the rolling
circle replication process used by l and a few other E. coli bacteriophages
(Section 15.1.3).
Single-stranded DNA is naturally “sticky” and the two separated polynucleotides produced by helicase action would immediately re-form base pairs
after the enzyme has passed, if allowed to. The single strands are also highly
susceptible to nuclease attack and are likely to be degraded if not protected
in some way. To avoid these unwanted outcomes, single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) attach to the polynucleotides and prevent them from reassociating or being degraded (Figure 15.15A). The E. coli SSB is made up of four identical subunits and probably works in a similar way to the major eukaryotic
SSB, called replication protein A (RPA), by enclosing the polynucleotide in a
channel formed by a series of SSBs attached side by side on the strand (Figure
15.15B). Detachment of the SSBs, which must occur when the replication
complex arrives to copy the single strands, is brought about by a second set
of proteins called replication mediator proteins (RMPs). As with helicases,
SSBs have diverse roles in different processes involving DNA unwinding.
After 1000–2000 nucleotides of the leading strand have been replicated, the
first round of discontinuous strand synthesis on the lagging strand can begin.
The primase, which is still associated with the DnaB helicase in the primosome, makes an RNA primer which is then extended by DNA polymerase III
(Figure 15.16). This is the same DNA polymerase III complex that is synthesizing the leading-strand copy, the complex comprising, in effect, two copies
of the polymerase, held together by a pair of t subunits. It is not two complete
copies of the polymerase because there is only a single g complex, containing
subunit g in association with d, d¢, c, and y. The main function of the g complex (sometimes called the “clamp loader”) is to interact with the b subunit
(the “sliding clamp”) in each half of the complex, and hence control the
attachment and removal of the enzyme from the template, a function that is
required primarily during lagging-strand replication when the enzyme has to
attach and detach repeatedly at the start and end of each Okazaki fragment.
Some models of the DNA polymerase III complex place the two enzymes in
opposite orientations to reflect the different directions in which DNA synthesis occurs, toward the replication fork on the leading strand and away from it

on the lagging strand. It is more likely, however, that the pair of enzymes face
the same direction and the lagging strand forms a loop, so that DNA synthesis can proceed in parallel as the polymerase complex moves forward in pace
with the progress of the replication fork (Figure 15.17).

The combination of the DNA polymerase III dimer and the primosome,
migrating along the parent DNA and carrying out most of the replicative
functions, is called the replisome. After its passage, the replication process
must be completed by joining up the individual Okazaki fragments. This is
not a trivial event because one member of each pair of adjacent Okazaki fragments still has its RNA primer attached at the point where ligation should
take place (Figure 15.18). Table 15.2 shows us that this primer cannot be
removed by DNA polymerase III, because this enzyme lacks the required
5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease activity. At this point, DNA polymerase III releases the lagging strand and its place is taken by DNA polymerase I, which does have a
5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease activity and so removes the primer, and usually the start of
the DNA component of the Okazaki fragment as well, extending the 3¢ end of
the adjacent fragment into the region of the template that is exposed. The two
Okazaki fragments now abut, with the terminal regions of both composed
entirely of DNA. All that remains is for the missing phosphodiester bond to be
put in place by a DNA ligase, linking the two fragments and completing replication of this region of the lagging strand.

replication in Escherichia coli.

The elongation phase of genome replication is similar in bacteria and
eukaryotes, although the details differ. The progress of the replication fork in
eukaryotes is maintained by helicase activity, although which of the several
eukaryotic helicases that have been identified are primarily responsible for
DNA unwinding during replication has not been established. The separated
polynucleotides are prevented from reattaching by single-strand binding
proteins, the main one of these in eukaryotes being RPA.
We begin to encounter unique features of the eukaryotic replication process
when we examine the method used to prime DNA synthesis. As described
above, the eukaryotic DNA polymerase a cooperates with the primase enzyme
to put in place the RNA–DNA primers at the start of the leading-strand copy
and at the beginning of each Okazaki fragment. However, DNA polymerase a
is not capable of lengthy DNA synthesis, presumably because it lacks the stabilizing effect of a sliding clamp equivalent to the b subunit of E. coli DNA
polymerase III or the PCNA accessory protein that aids the eukaryotic DNA
polymerase d. This means that although DNA polymerase a can extend the initial RNA primer with about 20 nucleotides of DNA, it must then be replaced by
the main replicative enzyme, DNA polymerase d (see Figure 15.13B).
The DNA polymerase d enzymes that copy the leading and lagging strands in
eukaryotes do not associate into a dimeric complex equivalent to the one
formed by DNA polymerase III during replication in E. coli. Instead, the two
copies of the polymerase remain separate. The function performed by the g
complex of the E. coli polymerase—controlling attachment and detachment
of the enzyme from the lagging strand—is carried out by a multisubunit
accessory protein called replication factor C (RFC).
As in E. coli, completion of lagging-strand synthesis requires removal of the
RNA primer from each Okazaki fragment. There appears to be no eukaryotic

The Replication Process

DNA polymerase with the 5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease activity needed for this purpose
and the process is therefore very different to that described for bacterial cells.
The central player is the “flap endonuclease,” FEN1 (previously called MF1),
which associates with the DNA polymerase d complex at the 3¢ end of an
Okazaki fragment, in order to degrade the primer from the 5¢ end of the adjacent fragment. Understanding exactly how this occurs is complicated by the
inability of FEN1 to initiate primer degradation because it is unable to
remove the ribonucleotide at the extreme 5¢ end of the primer, because this
ribonucleotide carries a 5¢–triphosphate group which blocks FEN1 activity
(Figure 15.19). One possibility is that most of the RNA component of the
primer is removed by RNase H, which can degrade the RNA part of a basepaired RNA–DNA hybrid, but cannot cleave the phosphodiester bond
between the last ribonucleotide and the first deoxyribonucleotide. However,
this ribonucleotide will carry a 5¢–monophosphate rather than 5¢–triphosphate and so can be removed by FEN1 (Figure 15.20A). This model has the
disadvantage that it assigns an essential role to RNase H, whereas experimental evidence suggests that cells lacking RNase H are still able to carry out lagging-strand replication. An alternative possibility is that a helicase breaks the
base pairs holding the primer to the template strand, enabling the primer to
be pushed aside by DNA polymerase d as it extends the adjacent Okazaki fragment into the region thus exposed (Figure 15.20B). The flap that results can
be cut off by FEN1, whose endonuclease activity can cleave the phosphodiester bond at the branch point where the displaced region attaches to the part
of the fragment that is still base-paired. This scheme raises the possibility that
both the RNA primer and all of the DNA originally synthesized by DNA polymerase a are removed. This is attractive because DNA polymerase a has no
3¢Æ5¢ proofreading activity (see Table 15.2) and therefore synthesizes DNA in
a relatively error-prone manner. Removal of this region as part of the flap
cleaved by FEN1, followed by resynthesis by DNA polymerase d (which does
have a proofreading activity and so makes a highly accurate copy of the template), would prevent these errors from becoming permanent features of the
daughter double helix.

The final difference between replication in bacteria and in eukaryotes is that
in eukaryotes there is no equivalent of the bacterial replisome. Instead, the
enzymes and proteins involved in replication form sizeable structures within
the nucleus, each structure containing hundreds or thousands of individual
replication complexes. These structures are immobile because of attachments

5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease activity, and which works in conjunction with RNase H to remove the
RNA primer and replace it with DNA. DNA polymerase I usually also replaces some of the
DNA from the Okazaki fragment before detaching from the template. This leaves a single
missing phosphodiester bond, which is synthesized by DNA ligase, completing this step in
the replication process.

The Replication Process

in bacteria and/or eukaryotes. Initial attempts to locate origins of replication
in archaeal genomes by searching for sequence motifs found at bacterial or
eukaryotic origins were unsuccessful. Subsequently, potential replication origins for a range of archaeal species were identified by statistical analysis of
the frequencies of the four nucleotides in different parts of each archaeal
genome, the rationale being that these frequencies might be significantly different to either side of an origin, as is the case in bacteria. For one species,
Pyrococcus abyssi, a potential origin identified by nucleotide frequency analysis lies in the region of the genome that is replicated first, and so may be the
true origin of replication.
The sequences of most of the proteins involved in the elongation phase of
archaeal genome replication, as predicted from their genes, are similar to the
equivalent eukaryotic versions. In particular, archaea have proteins that are
homologs of the eukaryotic RFC and PCNA. The archaeal DNA polymerase is
interesting because the subunit that specifies the DNA synthesis activity is
similar to the equivalent subunit of the eukaryotic DNA polymerase d,
whereas the proofreading function is conferred by a protein that appears to
be a homolog of subunit e of Escherichia coli DNA polymerase III.

15.2.3 Termination of replication
Replication forks proceed along linear genomes, or around circular ones,
generally unimpeded except when a region that is being transcribed is
encountered. DNA synthesis occurs at approximately five times the rate of
RNA synthesis, so the replication complex can easily overtake an RNA polymerase, but this probably does not happen: instead, it is thought that the
replication fork pauses behind the RNA polymerase, proceeding only when
the transcript has been completed.
Eventually the replication fork reaches the end of the molecule or meets a
second replication fork moving in the opposite direction. What happens next
is one of the least understood aspects of genome replication.

Replication of the E. coli genome terminates within a defined region
Bacterial genomes are replicated bidirectionally from a single point (see
Figure 15.8), which means that the two replication forks should meet at a
position diametrically opposite the origin of replication on the genome map.
However, if one fork is delayed, possibly because it has to replicate extensive
regions where transcription is occurring, then it might be possible for the
other fork to overshoot the halfway point and continue replication on the
“other side” of the genome (Figure 15.21). It is not immediately apparent why
this should be undesirable, the daughter molecules presumably being unaffected, but it is not allowed to happen because of the presence of terminator
sequences. Six of these have been identified in the E. coli genome (Figure
15.22A), each one acting as the recognition site for a sequence-specific DNAbinding protein called Tus.
The mode of action of Tus is quite unusual. When bound to a terminator
sequence, a Tus protein allows a replication fork to pass if the fork is moving
in one direction, but blocks progress if the fork is moving in the opposite
direction around the genome. The directionality is set by the orientation of
the Tus protein on the double helix. When approached from one direction, Tus
blocks the passage of the DnaB helicase, which is responsible for progression

then blocked by the second Tus, because
this one has its impenetrable wall of
b-strands facing toward the fork.

of the replication fork, because the helicase is faced with a “wall” of b-strands
which it is unable to penetrate. But when approaching from the other direction, DnaB is able to disrupt the structure of the Tus protein, probably
because of the effect that unwinding of the double helix has on Tus, and so is
able to pass by (Figure 15.22B).
The orientation of the termination sequences, and hence of the bound Tus
proteins, in the E. coli genome is such that both replication forks become
trapped within a relatively short region on the opposite side of the genome to
the origin (see Figure 15.22A). This ensures that termination always occurs at
or near the same position. Exactly what happens when the two replication
forks meet is unknown, but the event is followed by disassembly of the replisomes, either spontaneously or in a controlled fashion. The result is two
interlinked daughter molecules, which are separated by topoisomerase IV.

Little is known about termination of replication in eukaryotes
No sequences equivalent to bacterial terminators are known in eukaryotes,
and proteins similar to Tus have not been identified. Quite possibly, replication forks meet at random positions and termination simply involves ligation
of the ends of the new polynucleotides. We do know that the replication complexes do not break down, because these replication factories are permanent
features of the nucleus.
Rather than concentrating on the molecular events occurring when replication forks meet, attention has been focused on the difficult question of how
the daughter DNA molecules produced in a eukaryotic nucleus do not
become impossibly tangled up. Although DNA topoisomerases have the ability to untangle DNA molecules, it is generally assumed that tangling is kept to
a minimum so that extensive breakage-and-reunion reactions, as catalyzed
by topoisomerases (see Figure 15.4), can be avoided. Various models have
been proposed to solve this problem. One of these suggests that a eukaryotic
chromosome is not randomly packed into its nuclear territory (Section

Genomes Chapter 15

10.1.1), but is ordered around the replication factories, which appear to be
present in only limited numbers. It is envisaged that each factory replicates a
single region of the DNA, maintaining the daughter molecules in a specific
arrangement that avoids their entanglement. Initially, the two daughter molecules are held together by cohesin proteins, which are attached immediately
after passage of the replication fork by a process that appears to involve DNA
polymerase k, an enigmatic enzyme that is essential for replication but whose
only known role does not obviously require a DNA polymerase activity. The
cohesins maintain the alignment of the sister chromatids until the anaphase
stage of nuclear division, when they are cleaved by cutting proteins, enabling
the daughter chromosomes to separate (Figure 15.23).

15.2.4 Maintaining the ends of a linear DNA molecule
There is one final problem that we must consider before leaving the replication process. This concerns the steps that have to be taken to prevent the ends
of a linear, double-stranded molecule from gradually getting shorter during
successive rounds of chromosomal DNA replication. There are two ways in
which this shortening might occur:
G

G

The extreme 3¢ end of the lagging strand might not be copied because the
final Okazaki fragment cannot be primed, the natural position for the
priming site being beyond the end of the template (Figure 15.24A). The
absence of this Okazaki fragment means that the lagging-strand copy is
shorter than it should be. If the copy remains this length then when it acts
as a parent polynucleotide in the next round of replication the resulting
daughter molecule will be shorter than its grandparent.
If the primer for the last Okazaki fragment is placed at the extreme 3¢ end
of the lagging strand, then shortening will still occur, although to a lesser
extent, because this terminal RNA primer cannot be converted into DNA
by the standard processes for primer removal (Figure 15.24B). This is
because the methods for primer removal (as illustrated in Figure 15.18 for
bacteria and Figure 15.20 for eukaryotes) require extension of the 3¢ end
of an adjacent Okazaki fragment, which cannot occur at the very end of
the molecule.

Once this problem had been recognized, attention was directed at the telomeres, the unusual DNA sequences at the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes. We
noted in Section 7.1.2 that telomeric DNA is made up of a type of minisatellite sequence, being comprised of multiple copies of a short repeat motif,
5¢–TTAGGG–3¢ in most higher eukaryotes, a few hundred copies of this
sequence occurring in tandem repeats at each end of every chromosome. The
solution to the end-shortening problem lies with the way in which this telomeric DNA is synthesized.

Telomeric DNA is synthesized by the telomerase enzyme
Most of the telomeric DNA is copied in the normal fashion during DNA replication but this is not the only way in which it can be synthesized. To compensate for the limitations of the replication process, telomeres can be extended
by an independent mechanism catalyzed by the enzyme telomerase. This is
an unusual enzyme in that it consists of both protein and RNA. In the human
enzyme, the RNA component is 450 nucleotides in length and contains near
its 5¢ end the sequence 5¢–CUAACCCUAAC–3¢, whose central region is the
reverse complement of the human telomere repeat sequence 5¢–TTAGGG–3¢.
This enables telomerase to extend the telomeric DNA at the 3¢ end of a

Anaphase

attach immediately after passage of the
replication fork and hold the daughter
molecules together until anaphase. During
anaphase, the cohesins are cleaved,
enabling the replicated chromosomes to
separate prior to their distribution into
daughter nuclei (see Figure 3.15).

polynucleotide by the copying mechanism shown in Figure 15.25, in which
the telomerase RNA is used as a template for each extension step, the DNA
synthesis being carried out by the protein component of the enzyme, which
is a reverse transcriptase. The correctness of this model is indicated by comparisons between telomere repeat sequences and the telomerase RNAs of
other species (Table 15.3): in all organisms that have been looked at, the
telomerase RNA contains a sequence that enables it to make copies of the
repeat motif present at the organism’s telomeres. An interesting feature is
Figure 15.24 Two of the reasons why
linear DNA molecules could become
shorter after DNA replication. In both
examples, the parent molecule is replicated
in the normal way. A complete copy is
made of its leading strand, but in (A) the
lagging-strand copy is incomplete because
the last Okazaki fragment is not made. This
is because primers for Okazaki fragments
are synthesized at positions approximately
200 bp apart on the lagging strand. If one
Okazaki fragment begins at a position less
than 200 bp from the 3¢ end of the lagging
strand then there will not be room for
another priming site, and the remaining
segment of the lagging strand is not copied.
The resulting daughter molecule therefore
has a 3¢ overhang and, when replicated,
gives rise to a granddaughter molecule that
is shorter than the original parent. In (B) the
final Okazaki fragment can be positioned at
the extreme 3¢ end of the lagging strand,
but its RNA primer cannot be converted into
DNA because this would require extension
of another Okazaki fragment positioned
beyond the end of the lagging strand. It is
not clear if a terminal RNA primer can be
retained throughout the cell cycle, nor is it
clear if a retained RNA primer can be
copied into DNA during a subsequent round
of DNA replication. If the primer is not
retained or is not copied into DNA, then
one of the granddaughter molecules will be
shorter than the original parent.

that, in all organisms, the strand synthesized by telomerase has a preponderance of G nucleotides, and is therefore referred to as the G-rich strand.
Telomerase can only synthesize this G-rich strand. It is not clear how the other
polynucleotide—the C-rich strand—is extended, but it is presumed that when
the G-rich strand is long enough, the primase–DNA polymerase a complex
attaches at its end and initiates synthesis of complementary DNA in the normal way (Figure 15.26). This requires the use of a new RNA primer, so the
C-rich strand will still be shorter than the G-rich one, but the important point
is that the overall length of the chromosomal DNA has not been reduced.

The activity of telomerase must clearly be controlled very carefully to ensure
that the appropriate length extension is made at each chromosome end. One
part of this regulatory mechanism is provided by the TRF1 proteins that bind
to the telomere repeat sequences (Section 7.1.2). TRF1 induces the formation
of a folded chromatin structure that prevents the telomerase enzyme from
accessing the end of the chromosome. As the telomere shortens, the number
of bound TRF1 proteins decreases and the chromatin structure opens up,
enabling telomerase to attach to the end of the chromosome and extend the
telomere. As the telomere extends, TRF1 proteins reattach, inducing the
chromatin to return to its folded structure so that the telomerase is once
again excluded from the chromosome end. In effect, the TRF1 proteins mediate a negative feedback loop that regulates telomerase activity on a particular chromosome end. In mammalian cells, the closed chromatin structure
may involve formation of a “t-loop,” in which the free 3¢ end of the telomere
loops back, invades the double helix, and forms base pairs with its complementary sequence on the C-rich strand (Figure 15.27). This reaction is catalyzed by the second telomere-binding protein in humans, TRF2, and may
provide additional stabilization of a chromosome end that does not require
further extension.

Telomere length is implicated in cell senescence and cancer
Perhaps surprisingly, telomerase is not active in all mammalian cells. The
enzyme is functional in the early embryo, but after birth is active only in the
reproductive cells and stem cells. The latter are progenitor cells that divide
continually throughout the lifetime of an organism, producing new cells to
maintain organs and tissues in a functioning state. The best-studied examples are the hemopoietic stem cells of the bone marrow, which generate new
blood cells.
Cells that lack telomerase activity undergo chromosome shortening every
time they divide. Eventually, after many cell divisions, the chromosome ends

could become so truncated that essential genes are lost, but this is unlikely to
be a major cause of the defects that can occur in cells lacking telomerase
activity. Instead, the critical factor is the need to maintain a protein “cap” on
each chromosome end, to protect these ends from the effects of the DNA
repair enzymes that join together the uncapped ends that are produced by
accidental breakage of a chromosome (Section 16.2.4). The proteins that form
this protective cap, such as TRF2 in humans, recognize the telomere repeats
as their binding sequences, and so have no attachment points after the
telomeres have been deleted. If these proteins are absent then the repair
enzymes can make inappropriate linkages between the ends of intact,
although shortened, chromosomes; it is this that is probably the underlying
cause of the disruption to the cell cycle that results from telomere shortening.
Telomere shortening will therefore lead to the termination of a cell lineage.
For several years, biologists have attempted to link this process with cell
senescence, a phenomenon originally observed in cell cultures. All normal
cell cultures have a limited lifetime: after a certain number of divisions, the
cells enter a senescent state in which they remain alive but cannot divide
(Figure 15.28). With some mammalian cell lines, notably fibroblast cultures
(connective tissue cells), senescence can be delayed by engineering the cells
so that they synthesize active telomerase. These experiments suggest a clear
relationship between telomere shortening and senescence, but the exactness
of the link has been questioned, and any extrapolation from cell senescence
to aging of the organism is fraught with difficulties.
Not all cell lines display senescence. Cancerous cells are able to divide continuously in culture, their immortality being looked upon as analogous to
tumor growth in an intact organism. With several types of cancer, this
absence of senescence is associated with activation of telomerase, sometimes
to the extent that telomere length is maintained through multiple cell divisions, but often in such a way that the telomeres become longer than normal
because the telomerase is overactive. It is not clear if telomerase activation is
a cause or an effect of cancer, although the former seems more likely because
at least one type of cancer, dyskeratosis congenita, appears to result from a
mutation in the gene specifying the RNA component of human telomerase.
The question is critical to understanding the etiology of a cancer but is less
relevant to the therapeutic issue, which centers on whether telomerase could
be a target for drugs designed to combat the cancer. Such a therapy could be
successful even if telomerase activation is an effect of the cancer, because
inactivation by drugs would induce senescence of the cancer cells and hence
prevent their proliferation.

Telomeres in Drosophila
When the amino acid sequences of the protein subunits of telomerase
enzymes are compared with those of other reverse transcriptases, the closest
similarities are seen with the reverse transcriptases coded by the non-LTR
retroelements called retroposons (Section 9.2.1). This is a fascinating observation when taken in conjunction with the unusual structure of the telomeres
of Drosophila. These telomeres are not made up of the short repeated
sequences seen in most other organisms, but instead consist of tandem
arrays of much longer repeats, 6 or 10 kb in length. These repeats are fulllength copies of two Drosophila retroposons, related to LINE-1 of humans,
called HeT-A and TART. It is not known how these telomeres are maintained,
but it is conceivable that the process is analogous to that carried out by

telomerase, with a template RNA obtained by transcription of the telomeric
retroposons being copied by the reverse transcriptase coded by the TART
sequences (HeT-A does not have a reverse transcriptase gene).
The unusual structure of the Drosophila telomere could simply be a quirk of
nature, but the attractive possibility that the telomeres of other organisms are
degraded retroposons, as suggested by the similarities between telomerase
and retroposon reverse transcriptases, cannot be discounted.

15.3 Regulation of Eukaryotic Genome Replication
Genome replication in eukaryotic cells is regulated at two levels:
G

Replication is coordinated with the cell cycle so that two copies of the
genome are available when the cell divides.

G

The replication process itself can be arrested under certain circumstances, for example if the DNA is damaged and must be repaired before
copying can be completed.

We will end this chapter by looking at these regulatory mechanisms.

15.3.1 Coordination of genome replication and cell division
The concept of a cell cycle emerged from light microscopy studies carried out
by the early cell biologists. Their observations showed that dividing cells pass
through repeated cycles of mitosis—the period when nuclear and cell division occurs (see Figure 3.15)—and interphase, a less dramatic period when
few dynamic changes can be detected with the light microscope. It was
understood that chromosomes divide during interphase, so when DNA was
identified as the genetic material, interphase took on a new importance as
the period when genome replication must take place. This led to a reinterpretation of the cell cycle as a four-stage process (Figure 15.29), comprising:
G

Mitosis, or M phase, the period when the nucleus and cell divide.

G

Gap 1, or G1 phase, an interval when transcription, translation, and other
general cellular activities occur.

G

Synthesis, or S phase, when the genome is replicated.

G

Gap 2, or G2 phase, a second interval period.

It is clearly important that the S phase and M phase are coordinated so that
the genome is completely replicated, but replicated only once, before mitosis
occurs. The periods immediately before entry into S phase and M phase are
looked upon as key cell cycle checkpoints, and it is at one of these two points
that the cycle becomes arrested if critical genes involved in cell cycle control
are mutated, or if the cell undergoes trauma such as extensive DNA damage.
Attempts to understand how genome replication is coordinated with mitosis
have therefore concentrated on these two checkpoints, especially the pre-S
checkpoint, the period immediately before replication.

replication, these pre-RCs being converted to post-RCs as replication proceeds. A post-RC is unable to initiate replication and so cannot accidentally
recopy a piece of the genome before mitosis has occurred. The ORC, the complex of six proteins that is assembled onto domains A and B1 of a yeast origin
(see Figure 15.10B), was an early contender for the pre-RC but is probably not
a central component because ORCs are present at origins of replication at all
stages of the cell cycle. Instead, the ORC is looked on as the “landing pad” on
which the pre-RC is constructed.
Various types of protein have been implicated as components of the pre-RC.
The first is Cdc6p, which was originally identified in yeast and subsequently
shown to have homologs in higher eukaryotes. Yeast Cdc6p is synthesized at
the end of G2, as the cell enters mitosis, and becomes associated with chromatin in early G1 before disappearing at the end of G1, when replication
begins (Figure 15.30). The involvement of Cdc6p in the pre-RC is suggested by
experiments in which its gene is repressed, which results in an absence of
pre-RCs, and other experiments in which Cdc6p is overproduced, which
leads to multiple genome replications in the absence of mitosis. There is also
biochemical evidence for a direct interaction between Cdc6p and yeast ORCs.
A second component of the pre-RC is thought to be the group of proteins
called replication licensing factors (RLFs). As with Cdc6p, the first examples
of these proteins were identified in yeast (the MCM family of proteins) with
homologs in higher eukaryotes discovered at a later date. RLFs become
bound to chromatin toward the end of M phase and remain in place until the
start of S phase, after which they are gradually removed from the DNA as it is
replicated. Their removal may be the key event that converts a pre-RC into a
post-RC and so prevents reinitiation of replication at an origin that has
already directed a round of replication.

Regulation of pre-RC assembly
Identification of the components of the pre-RC takes us some distance
toward understanding how genome replication is initiated, but still leaves
open the question of how replication is coordinated with other events in the
cell cycle. Cell cycle control is a complex process, mediated largely by protein
kinases which phosphorylate and activate enzymes and other proteins that
have specific functions during the cell cycle. The same protein kinases are
present in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, so they must themselves be
subject to control. This control is exerted partly by proteins called cyclins
(which vary in abundance at different stages of the cell cycle), partly by other
protein kinases that activate the cyclin-dependent protein kinases, and partly
by inhibitory proteins. Even before we start looking for regulators of pre-RC
assembly we can anticipate that the control system will be convoluted.
A number of cyclins have been linked with activation of genome replication
and prevention of pre-RC reassembly after replication has been completed.
These include the mitotic cyclins, whose main function was originally
thought to be activation of mitosis but which also repress genome replication. When the effects of these cyclins are blocked by, for example, overproduction of proteins that inhibit their activity, the cell is not only incapable of
entering M phase but also undergoes repeated genome replication. There are
also more specific S-phase cyclins, such as Clb5p and Clb6p in S. cerevisiae,
inactivation of which delays or prevents genome replication, and other

cyclins that are active during G2 phase and prevent the assembly of pre-RCs
in the period after genome replication and before cell division (Figure 15.31).
In addition to these cyclin-dependent control systems, genome replication is
also regulated by a cyclin-independent protein kinase, Cdc7p-Dbf4p, found
in organisms as diverse as yeasts and mammals. The proteins activated by this
kinase have not been identified, separate lines of evidence suggesting that
both RLFs and ORCs are targeted. Whatever the mechanism, Cdc7p-Dbf4p
activity is a prerequisite for replication, the cyclin-dependent processes on
their own being insufficient to push the cell into S phase.

15.3.2 Control within S phase
Regulation of the G1–S transition can be looked upon as the major control
process affecting genome replication, but it is not the only one. The specific
events occurring during S phase are also subject to regulation.

Early and late replication origins
Initiation of replication does not occur at the same time at all replication origins, nor is “origin firing” an entirely random process. Some parts of the
genome are replicated early in S phase and some later, the pattern of replication being consistent from cell division to cell division. The general pattern is
that actively transcribed genes and the centromeres are replicated early in
S phase, and telomeres and nontranscribed regions of the genome are replicated later on. Early-firing origins are therefore tissue specific and reflect the
pattern of genome expression occurring in a particular cell.
These features of genome replication were originally extrapolated from
examination of just a few origins, but have recently been supplemented by
studies utilizing microarray technology. Microarray analysis is based on
hybridization probing, so to use a microarray to follow the pattern of
genome replication it is necessary to devise a way of separating unreplicated
DNA from replicated DNA, so that one or the other fraction can be used as a
hybridization probe. If, for example, a sample of replicated DNA is obtained
from cells that had just entered S phase, then this DNA could be used to
probe the microarray in order to identify those genes that have already been
replicated at this early stage. A second probe, prepared from replicated DNA
from slightly later in S phase, would identify the next set of genes to be replicated, and so on. For Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these fractions are obtained
by growing cells in medium with heavy nitrogen, transferring to normal

medium, and allowing the cells to enter S phase. The DNA is then extracted
at appropriate times during S phase, treated with a restriction endonuclease,
and fractionated by density gradient centrifugation (Figure 15.32). Two
bands are seen, one made up of fragments of 15N–15N–DNA, derived from
the unreplicated component of the genome, and the other made up of
14N–15N–DNA and hence derived from the regions that have undergone
replication. The latter fraction is purified, labeled with a fluorescent marker,
and applied to the microarray.

The analysis is simple but remarkably informative. Figure 15.33A charts the
dynamics of origin firing along yeast chromosome VI and identifies a region
midway along the shorter arm as the area where replication of this chromosome commences. As indicated by previous experiments, the centromere
(indicated by the circle on the x-axis in Figure 15.33A) is replicated early in S
phase, and the telomeres at the end of the replication cycle. Note that both
telomeres are replicated at approximately the same time. This observation
holds true for all yeast chromosomes, but not all chromosomes complete
their replication cycle at the same time. Some, such as chromosomes XI and
XV, are completely replicated early in S phase, and others, such as VIII and IX,
are not fully replicated until much later. These time differences are not related
to the length of the chromosome but instead indicate real variations in the
kinetics of chromosome replication. Figure 15.33B emphasizes this point,
showing that 15 minutes after the start of S phase, many of the origins in
chromosome XV have been activated whereas replication of chromosome XII
has only just begun. Microarray analysis also enables the migration rate of
individual replication forks to be inferred, again showing variability. The
mean speed is 2.9 kb per minute, but some forks move much more quickly, up
to 11 kb per minute for the most active ones.

Understanding what determines the firing time of a replication origin is proving quite difficult. It is not simply the sequence of the origin, because transfer
of a DNA segment from its normal position to another site in the same or a different chromosome can result in a change in the firing pattern of origins contained in that segment. This positional effect may be linked with chromatin
organization and hence influenced by structures such as locus control regions
(Section 10.1.2) that control DNA packaging. The position of the origin in the

nucleus may also be important as origins that become active at similar periods within S phase appear to be clustered together, at least in mammals.

Damage

Checkpoints within S phase
The final aspect of the regulation of genome replication that we will consider
is the function of the checkpoints that exist within S phase. These were first
identified when it was shown that one of the responses of yeast cells to DNA
damage is a slowing down and possibly a complete halting of the genome
replication process. This is linked with the activation of genes whose products
are involved in DNA repair (Section 16.2).
As with entry into S phase, cyclin-dependent kinases are implicated in the
regulation of S-phase checkpoints. These kinases respond to signals from
proteins associated with the replication fork. Replication-fork proteins,
including the PCNA and the accessory protein RFC, were initially assigned
roles in damage detection, but this role is probably not played by the versions
of these proteins involved in DNA synthesis. The damage-sensing version of
RFC has a different subunit composition to the standard RFC, and the sensing protein initially identified as a relative of PCNA appears to be a totally different protein (the 9-1-1 complex) that has a similar structure to PCNA and
probably interacts with the double helix in a similar manner. The signals from
the damage-sensing proteins are transduced by kinases such as ATM, ATR,
Chk1, and Chk2 to effector proteins such as Cdc25 which interact with the
cyclin-dependent kinases to elicit the appropriate cellular response (Figure
15.34). The replication process can be arrested by repressing the firing of origins of replication that are usually activated at later stages in S phase or by
slowing the progression of existing replication forks. If the damage is not
excessive then DNA repair processes are activated (Section 16.2); alternatively
the cell may be shunted into the pathway of programmed cell death called
apoptosis, the death of a single somatic cell as a result of DNA damage usually being less dangerous than allowing that cell to replicate its mutated DNA
and possibly give rise to a tumor or other cancerous growth. In mammals, a
central player in induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis is the protein
called p53. This is classified as a tumor-suppressor protein, because when this
protein is defective, cells with damaged genomes can avoid the S-phase
checkpoints and possibly proliferate into a cancer. p53 is a sequence-specific
DNA-binding protein that activates a number of genes thought to be directly
responsible for arrest and apoptosis, and also represses expression of other
genes that must be switched off to facilitate these processes.

Summary
In order to continue carrying out its function, the genome must replicate
every time that a cell divides. Watson and Crick pointed out, when they first
announced their discovery of the structure of DNA, that the specific base
pairing that holds the two strands of the double helix together provides a
means for accurate copying of each polynucleotide. They envisaged a semiconservative mode of replication in which each parent stand acts as a template for synthesis of a complementary daughter strand. The Meselson–Stahl
experiment showed that this interpretation is correct, but there were still
problems in understanding how the two strands of the helix were separated,
especially in circular molecules which have little freedom to rotate. The discovery of DNA topoisomerases, which separate the strands of the double

helix by repeated breakage and rejoining of one or both polynucleotides,
solved this problem. No exceptions to the semiconservative mode of replication are known, though there are specialized versions, such as displacement
replication and rolling circle replication. Initiation of genome replication
occurs at discrete origins which have been well characterized in bacteria and
in yeast, but which are less clearly understood in higher eukaryotes. Once
replication has been initiated, a pair of replication forks travel in opposite
directions along the DNA. DNA polymerase can only synthesize DNA in the
5¢Æ3¢ direction, which means that although one strand, called the leading
strand, can be replicated in a continuous fashion, the second, lagging strand
has to be copied in short segments. These are called Okazaki fragments. DNA
synthesis must be primed by an RNA polymerase, and the helix must be
unwound and the single strands stabilized by helicases and single-strand
binding proteins. The replicating complex, called the replisome in bacteria,
consists of the DNA polymerase enzyme along with ancillary proteins, such
as the sliding clamp, which ensures that the connection between the polymerase and the DNA is secure but that the polymerase is still able to move
along the DNA. Termination of replication occurs at specific regions within a
bacterial chromosome but at less-well-defined areas in eukaryotic chromosomes. Eukaryotic chromosomes require special processes to maintain their
ends, as replication results in a gradual shortening of the telomeres. These are
elongated by the telomerase enzyme, which has an RNA subunit that acts as
the template for synthesis of new telomere repeat units. Replication of the
genome must be coordinated with the cell cycle. This is achieved by a combination of regulatory proteins, many of which are active only at specific periods of the cell cycle. Assembly of the prereplication complex at origins of
replication is a critical step that is regulated to ensure that the genome is
replicated just once per cell cycle. Once replication is underway, checkpoints
during the synthesis phase respond to DNA damage in order to arrest or terminate genome replication.

Genomes are dynamic entities that change over time as a result of the cumulative effects of small-scale sequence alterations caused by mutation (Section
16.1). A mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a short region of
a genome (Figure 16.1A). Many mutations are point mutations (also called
simple mutations or single-site mutations) that replace one nucleotide with
another. Point mutations are divided into two categories: transitions, which

are purine-to-purine or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine changes (AÆG, GÆA,
CÆT, or TÆC), and transversions, which are purine-to-pyrimidine or pyrimidine-to-purine changes (AÆC, AÆT, GÆC, GÆT, CÆA, CÆG, TÆA, or
TÆG). Other mutations arise from insertion or deletion of one or a few
nucleotides.
Mutations result either from errors in DNA replication or from the damaging
effects of mutagens, such as chemicals and radiation, which react with DNA
and change the structures of individual nucleotides. All cells possess DNA
repair enzymes that attempt to minimize the number of mutations that
occur (Section 16.2). These enzymes work in two ways. Some are prereplicative and search the DNA for nucleotides with unusual structures, these
nucleotides being replaced before replication occurs; others are postreplicative and check newly synthesized DNA for errors, correcting any errors that
they find (Figure 16.1B). A possible definition of mutation is therefore a deficiency in DNA repair.
Mutations can have dramatic effects on the cell in which they occur, a mutation in a key gene possibly resulting in a defective protein which could lead to
death of the cell. Other mutations have a less-significant impact on the phenotype of the cell and many have none at all. As we will see in Chapter 18, all
events that are not lethal have the potential to contribute to the evolution of
the genome but for this to happen they must be inherited when the organism
reproduces. With a single-celled organism such as a bacterium or yeast, all
genome alterations that are not lethal or corrected are inherited by daughter
cells and become permanent features of the lineage that descends from the
original cell in which the alteration occurred. In a multicellular organism, only
those events that occur in germ cells are relevant to genome evolution.
Changes to the genomes of somatic cells are unimportant in an evolutionary
sense, but they will have biological relevance if they result in a deleterious
phenotype that affects the health of the organism.

16.1 Mutations
With mutations, we have to consider the following issues: how they arise; the
effects they have on the genome and on the organism in which the genome
resides; and whether it is possible for a cell to increase its mutation rate and
induce programmed mutations under certain circumstances.

16.1.1 The causes of mutations
Mutations arise in two ways:
G

Some mutations are spontaneous errors in replication that evade the
proofreading function of the DNA polymerases that synthesize new
polynucleotides at the replication fork (Section 15.2.2). These mutations
are called mismatches because they are positions where the nucleotide
that is inserted into the daughter polynucleotide does not match, by base
pairing, the nucleotide at the corresponding position in the template DNA
(Figure 16.2A). If the mismatch is not corrected in the daughter double
helix then one of the granddaughter molecules produced during the next
round of DNA replication will carry a permanent, double-stranded version of the mutation.

Other mutations arise because a mutagen has reacted with the parent
DNA, causing a structural change that affects the base-pairing capability
of the altered nucleotide. Usually this alteration affects only one strand of
the parent double helix, so only one of the daughter molecules carries the
mutation, but two of the granddaughter molecules produced during the
next round of replication will have it (Figure 16.2B).

Figure 16.2 Examples of mutations. (A)
An error in replication leads to a mismatch
in one of the daughter double helices, in
this case a TÆC change because one of
the As in the template DNA was miscopied.
When the mismatched molecule is itself
replicated, it gives one double helix with the
correct sequence and one with a mutated
sequence. (B) A mutagen has altered the
structure of an A in the lower strand of the
parent molecule, giving nucleotide X, which
does not base-pair with the T in the other
strand so, in effect, a mismatch has been
created. When the parent molecule is
replicated, X base-pairs with C, giving a
mutated daughter molecule. When this
daughter molecule is replicated, both
granddaughters inherit the mutation.

contexts. First, when the gene responsible for a genetic disease is initially identified it is usually necessary to examine
many versions of that gene from different individuals in
order to identify the mutation or mutations responsible for
the disease state. Second, when a disease-causing mutation has been characterized, high-throughput detection
methods are needed so that clinicians can screen many
DNA samples in order to identify individuals who have the
mutation and are at risk of developing the disease or passing it on to their children.
Any mutation can be identified by DNA sequencing, but
sequencing is relatively slow and would be inappropriate for
screening a large number of samples. DNA chip technology
(Technical Note 3.1) could also be employed, but this is not
yet a widely available option. For these reasons, a number
of “low technology” methods have been devised. These can
be divided into two categories: mutation scanning techniques, which require no prior information about the position of a mutation, and mutation screening techniques,
which determine whether a specific mutation is present.
Most mutation scanning techniques involve analysis of the
heteroduplex formed between a single strand of the DNA
being examined and the complementary strand of a control
DNA that has the unmutated sequence (Figure T16.1). If
the test DNA contains a mutation then there will be a single mismatched position in the heteroduplex, where a base
pair has not formed. Various techniques can be used to
determine whether this mismatch is present or not:
G

Electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) can detect the mismatch by identifying the difference in the mobility of the mismatched

of DNA, one of which contains a mutation, will result in a
double-stranded molecule with a mismatch.
Mismatch position

hybrid compared with the fully base-paired one in a
polyacrylamide gel or HPLC column. This approach
determines if a mismatch is present but does not provide information on where in the test DNA the mutation
is located.
G

Cleavage of the heteroduplex at the mismatch position
followed by gel electrophoresis will locate the position of
a mismatch. If the heteroduplex stays intact then no mismatch is present; if it is cleaved then it contains a mismatch, the position of the mutation in the test DNA being
indicated by the sizes of the cleavage products. Cleavage
is carried out by treatment with enzymes or chemicals
that cut at single-stranded regions of mainly doublestranded DNA, or with a single-strand-specific ribonuclease such as S1 (see Figure 5.14) if the hybrid has
been formed between the control DNA and an RNA version of the test DNA.

Most screening methods for detection of specific mutations
make use of the ability of oligonucleotide hybridization to
distinguish between target DNAs whose sequences differ at
just one nucleotide position (see Figure 3.8A). In allelespecific oligonucleotide (ASO) hybridization the DNA
samples are screened by probing with an oligonucleotide
that hybridizes only to the mutant sequence (Figure T16.2).
This is an efficient procedure but it is unnecessarily longwinded. The DNA samples are usually obtained by PCR of
clinical isolates so a more rapid alternative is to use the diagnostic oligonucleotide as one of the PCR primers, so that
the presence or absence of the mutation in the test DNA is
indicated by the synthesis or otherwise of a PCR product.

Errors in replication are a source of point mutations
When considered purely as a chemical reaction, complementary base pairing
is not particularly accurate. Nobody has yet devised a way of carrying out the
template-dependent synthesis of DNA without the aid of enzymes, but if the
process could be carried out simply as a chemical reaction in a test tube then
the resulting polynucleotide would probably have point mutations at 5–10
positions out of every hundred. This represents an error rate of 5%–10%,
which would be completely unacceptable during genome replication. The
template-dependent DNA polymerases that carry out DNA replication must
therefore increase the accuracy of the process by several orders of magnitude.
This improvement is brought about in two ways:
G

G

A DNA polymerase operates a nucleotide-selection process that dramatically increases the accuracy of template-dependent DNA synthesis (Figure
16.3A). This selection process probably acts at three different stages during
the polymerization reaction, discrimination against an incorrect
nucleotide occurring when the nucleotide is first bound to the DNA polymerase, when it is shifted to the active site of the enzyme, and when it is
attached to the 3¢ end of the polynucleotide that is being synthesized.
The accuracy of DNA synthesis is increased still further if the DNA polymerase possesses a 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity and so is able to remove an
incorrect nucleotide that evades the nucleotide-selection process and
becomes attached to the 3¢ end of the new polynucleotide (see Figure
2.7B). This is called proofreading (Section 15.2.2), but the name is a misnomer because the process is not a simple checking mechanism. Instead,
each step in the synthesis of a polynucleotide should be viewed as a competition between the polymerase and exonuclease functions of the
enzyme, the polymerase usually winning because it is more active than
the exonuclease, at least when the 3¢-terminal nucleotide is base-paired to
the template. But the polymerase activity is less efficient if the terminal
nucleotide is not base-paired, the resulting pause in polymerization
allowing the exonuclease activity to predominate so that the incorrect
nucleotide is removed (see Figure 16.3B).

Escherichia coli is able to synthesize DNA with an error rate of only 1 per 107
nucleotide additions. Interestingly, these errors are not evenly distributed
between the two daughter molecules, the product of lagging-strand replication being prone to about 20 times as many errors as the leading-strand replicate. This asymmetry might indicate that DNA polymerase I, which is involved
only in lagging-strand replication (Section 15.2.2), has a less-effective base
selection and proofreading capability compared with DNA polymerase III, the
main replicating enzyme.
Not all of the errors that occur during DNA synthesis can be blamed on the
polymerase enzymes: sometimes an error occurs even though the enzyme adds
the “correct” nucleotide, the one that base-pairs with the template. This is
because each nucleotide base can occur as either of two alternative tautomers,
structural isomers that are in dynamic equilibrium. For example, thymine
exists as two tautomers, the keto and enol forms, with individual molecules
occasionally undergoing a shift from one tautomer to the other. The equilibrium is biased very much toward the keto form but every now and then the
enol version of thymine occurs in the template DNA at the precise time that
the replication fork is moving past. This will lead to an “error,” because enolthymine base-pairs with G rather than A (Figure 16.4). The same problem can

Those errors that occur can be corrected by
“proofreading” if the polymerase has a
3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity. If the last
nucleotide that was inserted is base-paired
to the template then the polymerase activity
predominates, but if the last nucleotide is
not base-paired then the exonuclease
activity is favored.

As stated above, the error rate for DNA synthesis in E. coli is 1 in 107. However,
the overall error rate for replication of the E. coli genome is only 1 in 1010 to 1
in 1011, the improvement compared with the polymerase error rate being the
result of the mismatch repair system (Section 16.2.3) that scans newly replicated DNA for positions where the bases are unpaired and hence corrects the
few mistakes that the replication enzymes make. This means that, on average,
only one uncorrected replication error occurs every 2000 times that the E. coli
genome is copied.

tautomers but both pair with guanine.

Replication errors can also lead to insertion and deletion mutations
Not all errors in replication are point mutations. Aberrant replication can also
result in small numbers of extra nucleotides being inserted into the polynucleotide being synthesized, or some nucleotides in the template not being
copied. An insertion or deletion that occurs within a coding region might
result in a frameshift mutation, which changes the reading frame used for
translation of the protein specified by the gene (see Figure 16.12). There is a
tendency to use “frameshift” to describe all insertions and deletions, but this
is inaccurate as inserting or deleting three nucleotides, or multiples of three,
simply adds or removes codons or parts of adjacent codons without affecting
the reading frame. Also, of course, many insertions/deletions occur outside of
open reading frames, within the intergenic regions of a genome.
Insertion and deletion mutations can affect all parts of the genome but are
particularly prevalent when the template DNA contains short repeated
sequences, such as those found in microsatellites (Section 3.2.2). This is
because repeated sequences can induce replication slippage, in which the
template strand and its copy shift their relative positions so that part of the
template is either copied twice or missed out. The result is that the new
polynucleotide has a larger or smaller number, respectively, of the repeat
units (Figure 16.5). This is the main reason why microsatellite sequences are
so variable, replication slippage occasionally generating a new length variant,
adding to the collection of alleles already present in the population.
Replication slippage is probably also responsible for the trinucleotide repeat
expansion diseases that have been discovered in humans in recent years. Each
of these neurodegenerative diseases is caused by a relatively short series of
trinucleotide repeats becoming elongated to two or more times its normal
length. For example, the human HD gene contains the sequence 5¢–CAG–3¢
repeated between 6 and 35 times in tandem, coding for a series of glutamines
in the protein product. In Huntington’s disease this repeat expands to a copy
number of 36–121, increasing the length of the polyglutamine tract and resulting in a dysfunctional protein. Several other human diseases are also caused by
expansions of polyglutamine codons (Table 16.1). Some diseases associated
with mental retardation result from trinucleotide expansions in the leader
region of a gene, giving a fragile site, a position where the chromosome is likely
to break. Expansions involving intron and trailer regions are also known.
How triplet expansions are generated is not precisely understood. The size of
the insertion is much greater than occurs with normal replication slippage,

such as that seen with microsatellite sequences, and once the expansion
reaches a certain length it appears to become susceptible to further expansion in subsequent rounds of replication, so that the disease becomes
increasingly severe in succeeding generations. The possibility that expansion
involves formation of hairpin loops in the DNA has been raised, based on the
observation that only a limited number of trinucleotide sequences are known

The DMPK and X25 expansions are in the trailer and intron regions of their genes, respectively, and are thought to affect RNA processing. There are
also a few disease-causing mutations that involve expansions of longer sequences, for example progressive myoclonus epilepsy caused by a
(CCCCGCCCCGCG)2–3 to (CCCCGCCCCGCG)over 12 expansion in the promoter region of the EPM1 locus.

to undergo expansion, and all of these sequences are GC–rich and so might
form stable secondary structures. There is also evidence that at least one
triplet expansion region—for Friedreich’s ataxia—can form a triple helix
structure. Studies of similar triplet expansions in yeast have shown that these
are more prevalent when the RAD27 gene is inactivated, an interesting observation as RAD27 is the yeast version of the mammalian gene for FEN1, the
protein involved in processing of Okazaki fragments (Section 15.2.2). This
might indicate that a trinucleotide repeat expansion is caused by an aberration in lagging-strand synthesis.

Mutations are also caused by chemical and physical mutagens
Many chemicals that occur naturally in the environment have mutagenic
properties and these have been supplemented in recent years with other
chemical mutagens that result from human industrial activity. Physical
agents such as radiation are also mutagenic. Most organisms are exposed to
greater or lesser amounts of these various mutagens, their genomes suffering
damage as a result.
The definition of the term “mutagen” is a chemical or physical agent that
causes mutations. This definition is important because it distinguishes mutagens from other types of environmental agent that cause damage to cells in
ways other than by causing mutations (Table 16.2). There are overlaps
between these categories (for example, some mutagens are also carcinogens)
but each type of agent has a distinct biological effect. The definition of “mutagen” also makes a distinction between true mutagens and other agents that
damage DNA without causing mutations, for example by causing breaks in
DNA molecules. This type of damage may block replication and cause the cell
to die, but it is not a mutation in the strict sense of the term and the causative
agents are therefore not mutagens.
Mutagens cause mutations in three different ways:
G

Some act as base analogs and are mistakenly used as substrates when new
DNA is synthesized at the replication fork.

G

Some react directly with DNA, causing structural changes that lead to
miscopying of the template strand when the DNA is replicated. These
structural changes are diverse, as we will see when we look at individual
mutagens.

G

Some mutagens act indirectly on DNA. They do not themselves affect
DNA structure, but instead cause the cell to synthesize chemicals such as
peroxides that have a direct mutagenic effect.

Mutations

The range of mutagens is so vast that it is difficult to devise an all-embracing
classification. We will therefore restrict our study to the most common types.
For chemical mutagens these are as follows:
G

Base analogs are purine and pyrimidine bases that are similar enough to
the standard bases of DNA to be incorporated into nucleotides when
these are synthesized by the cell. The resulting unusual nucleotides can
then be used as substrates for DNA synthesis during genome replication.
For example, 5-bromouracil (5-bU; Figure 16.6A) has the same base-pairing properties as thymine, and nucleotides containing this base can be
added to the daughter polynucleotide at positions opposite As in the template. The mutagenic effect arises because the equilibrium between the
two tautomers of 5-bU is shifted more toward the rarer enol form than is
the case with thymine. This means that during the next round of replication there is a relatively high chance of the polymerase encountering enol5bU, which (like enol-thymine) pairs with G rather than A (Figure 16.6B).
This results in a point mutation (Figure 16.6C). 2-Aminopurine acts in a
similar way: it is an analog of adenine with an amino-tautomer that pairs
with thymine, and an imino-tautomer that pairs with cytosine, the imino
form being more common than imino-adenine and hence inducing T-toC transitions during DNA replication.

Deaminating agents also cause point mutations. A certain amount of
base deamination (removal of an amino group) occurs spontaneously in
genomic DNA molecules, with the rate being increased by chemicals such
as nitrous acid, which deaminates adenine, cytosine, and guanine
(thymine has no amino group and so cannot be deaminated), and sodium
bisulfite, which acts only on cytosine. Deamination of guanine is not
mutagenic because the resulting base, xanthine, blocks replication when
it appears in the template polynucleotide. Deamination of adenine gives
hypoxanthine (Figure 16.7), which pairs with C rather than T, and deamination of cytosine gives uracil, which pairs with A rather than G.
Deamination of these two bases therefore results in point mutations when
the template strand is copied.

G

Alkylating agents are a third type of mutagen that can give rise to point
mutations. Chemicals such as ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) and
dimethylnitrosamine add alkyl groups to nucleotides in DNA molecules,
as do methylating agents such as methyl halides, which are present in the
atmosphere, and the products of nitrite metabolism. The effect of alkylation depends on the position at which the nucleotide is modified and the
type of alkyl group that is added. Methylations, for example, often result in
modified nucleotides with altered base-pairing properties and so lead to
point mutations. Other alkylations block replication by forming crosslinks between the two strands of a DNA molecule, or by adding large alkyl
groups that prevent progress of the replication complex.

G

Intercalating agents are usually associated with insertion mutations. The
best-known mutagen of this type is ethidium bromide, which fluoresces
when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and so is used to reveal the
positions of DNA bands after agarose gel electrophoresis (see Technical
Note 2.2). Ethidium bromide and other intercalating agents are flat molecules that can slip between base pairs in the double helix, slightly unwinding the helix and hence increasing the distance between adjacent base
pairs (Figure 16.8).

(B) The mutagenic effect

The most important types of physical mutagen are as follows:
G

Ultraviolet radiation of wavelength 260 nm induces dimerization of adjacent pyrimidine bases, especially if these are both thymines (Figure
16.9A), resulting in a cyclobutyl dimer. Other pyrimidine combinations
also form dimers, the order of frequency with which this occurs being
5¢–CT–3¢ greater than 5¢–TC–3¢ greater than 5¢–CC–3¢. Purine dimers are
much less common. UV-induced dimerization usually results in a deletion
mutation when the modified strand is copied. Another type of UVinduced photoproduct is the (6–4) lesion, in which carbons number 4
and 6 of adjacent pyrimidines become covalently linked (Figure 16.9B).

G

Ionizing radiation has various effects on DNA depending on the type of
radiation and its intensity. Point, insertion, and/or deletion mutations
might arise, as well as more severe forms of DNA damage that prevent
subsequent replication of the genome. Some types of ionizing radiation
act directly on DNA, others act indirectly by stimulating the formation of
reactive molecules such as peroxides in the cell.

G

Heat stimulates the water-induced cleavage of the b-N-glycosidic bond
that attaches the base to the sugar component of the nucleotide (Figure
16.10A). This occurs more frequently with purines than with pyrimidines
and results in an AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic) site, or baseless site. The

sugar–phosphate that is left is unstable and rapidly degrades, leaving a
gap if the DNA molecule is double stranded (Figure 16.10B). This reaction
is not normally mutagenic because cells have effective systems for repairing gaps (Section 16.2.2), which is reassuring when one considers that
10,000 AP sites are generated in each human cell per day. Gaps do, however, lead to mutations under certain circumstances, for example in E. coli
when the SOS response is activated, when gaps are filled with As regardless of the identity of the nucleotide in the other strand (Section 16.2.5).

16.1.2 The effects of mutations
When considering the effects of mutations we must make a distinction
between the direct effect that a mutation has on the functioning of a genome
and its indirect effect on the phenotype of the organism in which it occurs.
The direct effect is relatively easy to assess because we can use our understanding of gene structure and expression to predict the impact that a mutation will have on genome function. The indirect effects are more complex
because these relate to the phenotype of the mutated organism which, as
described in Section 5.2.2, is often difficult to correlate with the activities of
individual genes.

The effects of mutations on genomes
Many mutations result in nucleotide sequence changes that have no effect on
the functioning of the genome. These silent mutations include virtually all of
those that occur in intergenic DNA and in the noncoding components of
genes and gene-related sequences. In other words, some 98.5% of the human
genome can be mutated without significant effect.
Mutations in the coding regions of genes are much more important. First, we
will look at point mutations that change the sequence of a triplet codon. A
mutation of this type will have one of four effects (Figure 16.11):
G

It may result in a synonymous change, the new codon specifying the same
amino acid as the unmutated codon. A synonymous change is therefore a
silent mutation because it has no effect on the coding function of the
genome: the mutated gene codes for exactly the same protein as the
unmutated gene.

G

It may result in a nonsynonymous change, the mutation altering the
codon so that it specifies a different amino acid. The protein coded by the
mutated gene therefore has a single amino acid change. This often has no
significant effect on the biological activity of the protein because most
proteins can tolerate at least a few amino acid changes without noticeable
effect on their ability to function in the cell, but changes to some amino
acids, such as those at the active site of an enzyme, have a greater impact.
A nonsynonymous change is also called a missense mutation.

Figure 16.11 Effects of point mutations
on the coding region of a gene. Four
different effects of point mutations are
shown. The readthrough mutation results in
the gene being extended beyond the end
of the sequence shown here, the leucine
codon created by the mutation being
followed by AAA = lys, TAT = tyr, and
ATA = ile. See Figure 1.20 for the genetic
code.

G

The mutation may convert a codon that specifies an amino acid into a termination codon. This is a nonsense mutation and it results in a shortened
protein because translation of the mRNA stops at this new termination
codon rather than proceeding to the correct termination codon further
downstream. The effect of this on protein activity depends on how much
of the polypeptide is lost: usually the effect is drastic and the protein is
nonfunctional.

G

The mutation could convert a termination codon into one specifying an
amino acid, resulting in readthrough of the stop signal so the protein is
extended by an additional series of amino acids at its C terminus. Most
proteins can tolerate short extensions without an effect on function, but
longer extensions might interfere with folding of the protein and so result
in reduced activity.

Deletion and insertion mutations also have distinct effects on the coding
capabilities of genes (Figure 16.12). If the number of deleted or inserted
nucleotides is three or a multiple of three, then one or more codons are
removed or added, the resulting loss or gain of amino acids having varying
effects on the function of the encoded protein. Deletions or insertions of this
type are often inconsequential but will have an impact if, for example, amino
acids involved in an enzyme’s active site are lost, or if an insertion disrupts an
important secondary structure in the protein. On the other hand, if the number of deleted or inserted nucleotides is not three or a multiple of three, then
a frameshift results, all of the codons downstream of the mutation being
taken from a different reading frame from that used in the unmutated gene.

Figure 16.12 Deletion mutations. In the
top sequence, three nucleotides comprising
a single codon are deleted. This shortens
the resulting protein product by one amino
acid but does not affect the rest of its
sequence. In the lower section, a single
nucleotide is deleted. This results in a
frameshift so that all the codons
downstream of the deletion are changed,
including the termination codon which is
now read through. Note that if a threenucleotide deletion removes parts of
adjacent codons then the result is more
complicated than shown here. Consider, for
example, deletion of the trinucleotide GCA
from the sequence ...ATGGGCAAATAT...
coding for met–gly–lys–tyr. The new
sequence is ...ATGGAATAT... coding for
met–glu–tyr. Two amino acids have been
replaced by a single, different one.

This usually has a significant effect on the protein function, because a greater
or lesser part of the mutated polypeptide has a completely different sequence
to the normal polypeptide.
It is less easy to make generalizations about the effects of mutations that
occur outside of the coding regions of the genome. Any protein-binding site
is susceptible to point, insertion, or deletion mutations that change the identity or relative positioning of nucleotides involved in the DNA–protein interaction. These mutations therefore have the potential to inactivate promoters
or regulatory sequences, with predictable consequences for gene expression
(Figure 16.13; Sections 11.2 and 11.3). Origins of replication could conceivably be made nonfunctional by mutations that change, delete, or disrupt
sequences recognized by the relevant binding proteins (Section 15.2.1) but
these possibilities are not well documented. There is also little information
about the potential impact on gene expression of mutations that affect nucleosome positioning (Section 10.2.2).
One area that has been better researched concerns mutations that occur in
introns or at exon–intron boundaries. In these regions, individual point
mutations will be important if they change nucleotides involved in the
RNA–protein and RNA–RNA interactions that occur during splicing of different types of intron (Sections 12.2.2 and 12.2.4). For example, mutation of
either the G or T in the DNA copy of the 5¢ splice site of a GU–AG intron, or of
the A or G at the 3¢ splice site, will disrupt splicing because the correct
exon–intron boundary will no longer be recognized. This may mean that the
intron is not removed from the pre-mRNA, but it is more likely that a cryptic
splice site (see Figure 12.28B) will be used as an alternative. It is also possible
for a mutation within an intron or an exon to create a new cryptic site that is
preferred over a genuine splice site that is not itself mutated. Both types of
event have the same result: relocation of the active splice site, leading to aberrant splicing. This might delete part of the resulting protein, add a new stretch
of amino acids, or lead to a frameshift. Several versions of the blood disease
b-thalassemia are caused by mutations that lead to cryptic splice site selection during processing of b-globin transcripts.

The effects of mutations on multicellular organisms
Now we turn to the indirect effects that mutations have on organisms, beginning with multicellular diploid eukaryotes such as humans. The first issue to
consider is the relative importance of the same mutation in a somatic cell
compared with a germ cell. Because somatic cells do not pass copies of their

Genomes Chapter 16

27/3/06

1:04 pm

Page 519

Mutations

genomes to the next generation, a somatic cell mutation is important only for
the organism in which it occurs: it has no potential evolutionary impact. In
fact, most somatic cell mutations have no significant effect, even if they result
in cell death, because there are many other identical cells in the same tissue
and the loss of one cell is immaterial. An exception is when a mutation causes
a somatic cell to malfunction in a way that is harmful to the organism, for
instance by inducing tumor formation or other cancerous activity.
Mutations in germ cells are more important because they can be transmitted
to members of the next generation and will then be present in all the cells of
any individual who inherits the mutation. Most mutations, including all
silent ones and many in coding regions, will still not change the phenotype of
the organism in any significant way. Those that do have an effect can be
divided into two categories:
G

Loss-of-function is the normal result of a mutation that reduces or abolishes a protein activity. Most loss-of-function mutations are recessive,
because in a heterozygote the second chromosome copy carries an unmutated version of the gene coding for a fully functional protein whose presence compensates for the effect of the mutation (Figure 16.14). There are
some exceptions where a loss-of-function mutation is dominant, one
example being haploinsufficiency, where the organism is unable to tolerate the approximately 50% reduction in protein activity suffered by the
heterozygote. This is the explanation for a few genetic diseases in humans,
including Marfan syndrome which results from a mutation in the gene for
the connective tissue protein called fibrillin.

G

Gain-of-function mutations are much less common. The mutation must
be one that confers an abnormal activity on a protein. Many gain-of-function mutations are in regulatory sequences rather than in coding regions,
and can therefore have a number of consequences. For example, a mutation might lead to one or more genes being expressed in the wrong tissues,
these tissues gaining functions that they normally lack. Alternatively the
mutation could lead to overexpression of one or more genes involved in
control of the cell cycle, thus leading to uncontrolled cell division and
hence to cancer. Because of their nature, gain-of-function mutations are
usually dominant.

Assessing the effects of mutations on the phenotypes of multicellular organisms can be difficult. Not all mutations have an immediate impact: some are
delayed onset and only confer an altered phenotype later in the individual’s
life. Other mutations display nonpenetrance in some individuals, never being
expressed even though the individual has a dominant mutation or is a homozygous recessive. With humans, these factors complicate attempts to map disease-causing mutations by pedigree analysis (Section 3.2.4) because they introduce uncertainty about which members of a family carry a mutant allele.

The effects of mutations on microorganisms
Mutations in microbes such as bacteria and yeast can also be described as
loss-of-function or gain-of-function, but with microorganisms this is neither
the normal nor the most useful classification scheme. Instead, a more
detailed description of the phenotype is usually attempted on the basis of the
growth properties of mutated cells in various culture media. This enables
most mutations to be assigned to one of four categories:

which provides just the basic nutritional
requirements for bacterial growth (nitrogen,
carbon, and energy sources, plus some
salts). The medium on the left is
supplemented with tryptophan but the
medium on the right is not. Unmutated
bacteria, plus tryptophan auxotrophs, can
grow on the plate on the left, the
auxotrophs growing because the medium
supplies the tryptophan that they cannot
make themselves. Tryptophan auxotrophs
cannot grow on the plate on the right
because this does not contain tryptophan.
(B) To identify a tryptophan auxotroph,
colonies are first grown on the minimal

transferred to the minimal medium plate by
replica plating. After incubation, colonies
appear on the minimal medium plate in the
same relative positions as on the plate
containing tryptophan, except for the
tryptophan auxotrophs which do not grow.
These colonies can therefore be identified
and samples of the tryptophan auxotrophic
bacteria recovered from the minimal
medium + tryptophan plate.

G

Auxotrophs are cells that will only grow when provided with a nutrient
not required by the unmutated organism. For example, E. coli normally
makes its own tryptophan, courtesy of the enzymes coded by the five
genes in the tryptophan operon (Figure 8.8B). If one of these genes is
mutated in such a way that its protein product is inactivated, then the cell
is no longer able to make tryptophan and so becomes a tryptophan auxotroph. It cannot survive on a medium that lacks tryptophan, and can
grow only when this amino acid is provided as a nutrient (Figure 16.15).
Unmutated bacteria, which do not require extra supplements in their
growth media, are called prototrophs.

G

Conditional-lethal mutants are unable to withstand certain growth conditions: under permissive conditions they appear to be entirely normal
but when transferred to restrictive conditions the mutant phenotype is
seen. Temperature-sensitive mutants are typical examples of conditional-lethal mutants. Temperature-sensitive mutants behave like wildtype cells at low temperatures but exhibit their mutant phenotype when
the temperature is raised above a certain threshold, which is different for
each mutant. Usually this is because the mutation reduces the stability of
a protein, so the protein becomes unfolded and hence inactive when the
temperature is raised.

G

Inhibitor-resistant mutants are able to resist the toxic effects of an antibiotic or another type of inhibitor. There are various molecular explanations
for this type of mutant. In some cases the mutation changes the structure
of the protein that is targeted by the inhibitor, so the latter can no longer
bind to the protein and interfere with its function. This is the basis of
streptomycin resistance in E. coli, which results from a change in the
structure of ribosomal protein S12. Another possibility is that the mutation changes the properties of a protein responsible for transporting the
inhibitor into the cell, this often being the way in which resistance to toxic
metals is acquired.

G

Regulatory mutants have defects in promoters and other regulatory
sequences. This category includes constitutive mutants, which continuously express genes that are normally switched on and off under different
conditions. For example, a mutation in the operator sequence of the lactose operon (Section 11.3.1) can prevent the repressor from binding and
so result in the lactose operon being expressed all the time, even when lactose is absent and the genes should be switched off (Figure 16.16).

In addition to these four categories, many mutations are lethal and so result
in death of the mutant cell, whereas others have no effect. The latter are less

Genomes Chapter 16

Mutations

common in microorganisms than in higher eukaryotes, because most microbial genomes are relatively compact, with little noncoding DNA. Mutations
can also be leaky, meaning that a less extreme form of the mutant phenotype
is expressed. For example, a leaky version of the tryptophan auxotroph illustrated in Figure 16.15 would grow slowly on minimal medium, rather than not
growing at all.

16.1.3 Hypermutation and the possibility of programmed
mutations
Is it possible for cells to utilize mutations in a positive fashion, either by
increasing the rate at which mutations appear in their genomes, or by directing mutations toward specific genes? Both types of event might appear, at
first glance, to go against the accepted wisdom that mutations occur randomly. The randomness of mutations is an important concept in biology
because it is a requirement of the Darwinian view of evolution, which holds
that changes in the characteristics of an organism occur by chance and are
not influenced by the environment in which the organism is placed. In contrast, the Lamarckian theory of evolution, which biologists rejected well over
a century ago, states that organisms acquire changes that enable them to
adapt to their environment. The Darwinian view requires that mutations
occur at random, whereas Lamarckian evolution demands that mutations
occur in response to the environment.
Two phenomena that, at first glance, appear to contravene the notion that
mutations occur at random are hypermutation and programmed mutations.

Hypermutation results from abnormal DNA repair processes
Hypermutation occurs when a cell allows the rate at which mutations occur
in its genome to increase. Several examples of hypermutation are known, one
of these forming part of the mechanism used by some vertebrates, including
humans, to generate a diverse array of immunoglobulin proteins. We have
already touched on this phenomenon in Section 14.2.1 when we examined
the genome rearrangements that result in joining of the V, D, J, and C segments of the immunoglobulin heavy- and light-chain genes (see Figure
14.19). Additional diversity is produced by hypermutation of the V gene segments after assembly of the intact immunoglobulin gene (Figure 16.17), the
mutation rate for these segments being 6–7 orders of magnitude greater than
the background mutation rate experienced by the rest of the genome.
The precise mechanism for V gene segment hypermutation is unknown and
several models have been proposed based on the available experimental

lactose operon is transcribed all the time,
even when lactose is absent from the
medium. This is not the only way in which
a constitutive lac mutant can arise. For
example, the mutation could be in the gene
coding for the lactose repressor, changing
the tertiary structure of the repressor protein
so that its DNA-binding motif is disrupted
and it can no longer recognize the operator
sequence, even when the latter is
unmutated. See Figure 11.24 for more
details about the lactose repressor and its
regulatory effect on expression of the
lactose operon.

evidence. At first, the enhanced mutation rate was thought to result from
unusual behavior of the mismatch repair system which normally corrects
replication errors (see Section 16.2.3). At all other positions within the
genome, mismatch repair corrects errors of replication by searching for mismatches and replacing the nucleotide in the daughter strand, this being the
strand that has just been synthesized and so contains the error. It was
thought that at V gene segments, the repair system changes the nucleotide in
the parent strand, and so stabilizes the mutation rather than correcting it
(Figure 16.18A). More recently, it has been shown that two enzymes—a cytosine deaminase and uracil-DNA glycosylase—are required for V segment
hypermutation. This has led to the suggestion that hypermutation is brought
about by conversion of some cytosine bases into uracils (by the deaminase)
followed by excision of the uracils (by the glycosylase) to produce AP sites
(Figure 16.18B). This is similar to the early steps in the base excision repair
process (Section 16.2.2), in which a uracil resulting from the action of a
deaminating mutagen is excised by uracil-DNA glycosylase. In base excision
repair, the AP site would then be filled in by DNA polymerase b, to restore the
original sequence, but in hypermutation the AP sites are not repaired. This
means that during the next round of replication, any of the four nucleotides
could be placed in the daughter strand opposite each AP site—a T in the
example shown in Figure 16.18B. A further round of replication then stabilizes the mutation.

Programmed mutations appear to support the Lamarckian theory
of evolution
An apparent increase in mutation rate arising from modifications to the normal DNA repair process does not contradict the dogma regarding the randomness of mutations. On the other hand, reports dating back to 1988, suggesting that E. coli is able to direct mutations toward genes whose mutation
would be advantageous under the environmental conditions that the bacterium is encountering, are much more difficult to explain.
The randomness of mutations in bacteria was first demonstrated by Luria and
Delbrück in 1943. They grew a series of E. coli cultures in different flasks and
then added T1 bacteriophages to each one. Most of the bacteria were killed by
the phages, but a few T1-resistant mutants were able to survive. These were
identified by plating samples from each culture, soon after T1 infection, onto
an agar medium. If mutations leading to T1 resistance occurred randomly in
the cultures before the bacteriophages were added, each culture would contain a different number of resistant mutants, the number depending on how
early during the growth period the first mutant cells arose (Figure 16.19).
Those that arose early would divide many times to give rise to a large number
of resistant progeny in the culture at the end of the growth period, whereas
those that arose later would give rise to just a few progeny. Some cultures
would therefore contain many T1-resistant cells and others would contain
just a few. Alternatively, if resistant bacteria arose by programmed mutation
only when the T1 phage was added, then all cultures would have similar numbers of mutants. Luria and Delbrück found that each of their cultures contained a different number of T1-resistant bacteria; thus, they concluded that
mutations occur randomly and not in response to T1 phage.
The possibility that Luria and Delbrück’s conclusion might not be universally
true for E. coli mutations was first suggested by studies of an E. coli strain

that carries a nonsense mutation in its lacZ gene. The presence of the termination codon in lacZ means that these cells are unable to synthesize functional b-galactosidase enzymes and so cannot use lactose as a carbon and
energy source—they are therefore lactose auxotrophs. This is not necessarily
a permanent situation because a cell could undergo a mutation that converts the termination codon back into one specifying an amino acid. These
new mutants would be able to make b-galactosidase and use any lactose that
is available. According to Luria and Delbrück’s results, such mutations
should occur at random and should not be influenced by the presence of lactose in the medium. But studies have shown that when the lactose auxotrophs are plated onto a minimal medium containing lactose as the only
sugar—circumstances that require that the bacteria must mutate into lactose prototrophs in order to survive—then the number of lactose prototrophs that arise is significantly higher than that expected if mutations
occurred randomly. In other words, some cells undergo programmed mutation and acquire the specific change in DNA sequence needed to withstand
the selective pressure.
These experiments suggest that bacteria can program mutations according to
the selective pressures to which they are exposed. In other words, the environment can directly affect the phenotype of the organism, as suggested by
Lamarck, rather than operating through the random processes postulated by
Darwin. With such radical implications, it is not surprising that the experiments
have been debated at length, with numerous attempts to discover flaws in their
design or alternative explanations for the results. Variations of the lacZ experimental system have suggested that the original results are authentic, and similar events in other bacteria have been described. Models based on gene amplification rather than selective mutation are being tested, and attention has also

mutations. The results obtained by Luria
and Delbrück are shown on the left. During
growth of the E. coli cultures, mutations that
give resistance to T1 bacteriophage occur
randomly at various times, meaning that
each culture has a different number of
resistant cells when the phages are added.
Variable numbers of colonies are therefore
seen when the bacteria are plated onto
solid medium. The result that would have
been obtained if programmed mutations
had occurred is shown on the right. Now
the T1-resistant bacteria acquire their
mutations in response to exposure to the
phages, and each plate therefore has a
similar number of colonies.

been directed at the possible roles of recombination events, such as transposition of insertion elements, in the generation of programmed mutations.

16.2 DNA Repair
In view of the thousands of damage events that genomes suffer every day,
coupled with the errors that occur when the genome replicates, it is essential
that cells possess efficient repair systems. Without these repair systems a
genome would not be able to maintain its essential cellular functions for
more than a few hours before key genes became inactivated by DNA damage.
Similarly, cell lineages would accumulate replication errors at such a rate that
their genomes would become dysfunctional after a few cell divisions.
Most cells possess four different categories of DNA repair system (Figure 16.20):
G

Direct repair systems (Section 16.2.1), as the name suggests, act directly on
damaged nucleotides, converting each one back to its original structure.

G

Excision repair (Section 16.2.2) involves excision of a segment of the
polynucleotide containing a damaged site, followed by resynthesis of the
correct nucleotide sequence by a DNA polymerase.

G

Mismatch repair (Section 16.2.3) corrects errors of replication, again by
excising a stretch of single-stranded DNA containing the offending
nucleotide and then repairing the resulting gap.

G

Nonhomologous end-joining (Section 16.2.4) is used to mend doublestrand breaks.

Most, if not all, organisms also possess systems that enable them to replicate
damaged regions of their genome without prior repair. We will examine these
systems in Section 16.2.5, and in Section 16.2.6 we will survey the human diseases that result from defects in DNA repair processes.

16.2.1 Direct repair systems fill in nicks and correct some
types of nucleotide modification

Nick

Most of the types of DNA damage that are caused by chemical or physical
mutagens (Section 16.1.1) can only be repaired by excision of the damaged
nucleotide followed by resynthesis of a new stretch of DNA, as shown in
Figure 16.20B. Only a few types of damaged nucleotide can be repaired
directly:
G

G

G

Nicks can be repaired by a DNA ligase if all that has happened is that a
phosphodiester bond has been broken, without damage to the 5¢–phosphate and 3¢–hydroxyl groups of the nucleotides either side of the nick
(Figure 16.21). This is often the case with nicks resulting from the effects
of ionizing radiation.
Some forms of alkylation damage are directly reversible by enzymes that
transfer the alkyl group from the nucleotide to their own polypeptide
chains. Enzymes capable of doing this are known in many different organisms and include the Ada enzyme of E. coli, which is involved in an adaptive process that this bacterium is able to activate in response to DNA
damage. Ada removes alkyl groups attached to the oxygen groups at positions 4 and 6 of thymine and guanine, respectively, and can also repair
phosphodiester bonds that have become methylated. Other alkylation
repair enzymes have more restricted specificities, an example being
human MGMT (O6-methylguanine–DNA methyltransferase) which, as its
name suggests, only removes alkyl groups from position 6 of guanine.
Cyclobutyl dimers are repaired by a light-dependent direct system called
photoreactivation. In E. coli, the process involves the enzyme called DNA
photolyase (more correctly named deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase).
When stimulated by light with a wavelength between 300 nm and 500
nm the enzyme binds to cyclobutyl dimers and converts them back to the
original monomeric nucleotides. Photoreactivation is a widespread but
not universal type of repair: it is known in many but not all bacteria and
also in quite a few eukaryotes, including some vertebrates, but is absent in
humans and other placental mammals. A similar type of photoreactivation involves the (6–4) photoproduct photolyase and results in repair of
(6–4) lesions. Neither E. coli nor humans have this enzyme but it is possessed by a variety of other organisms.

16.2.2 Excision repair
The direct types of damage reversal described above are important, but they
form a very minor component of the DNA repair mechanisms of most organisms. This point is illustrated by the human genome sequence, which appears
to contain just a single gene coding for a protein involved in direct repair (the
MGMT gene), but which has at least 40 genes for components of the excision
repair pathways. These pathways fall into two categories:
G

Base excision repair involves removal of a damaged nucleotide base, excision of a short piece of the polynucleotide around the AP site thus created,
and resynthesis with a DNA polymerase.

G

Nucleotide excision repair is similar to base excision repair but is not preceded by removal of a damaged base and can act on more substantially
damaged areas of DNA.

We will examine each of these pathways in turn.

Base excision repairs many types of damaged nucleotide
Base excision is the least complex of the various repair systems that involve
removal of one or more nucleotides followed by resynthesis of DNA to span the
resulting gap. It is used to repair many modified nucleotides whose bases have
suffered relatively minor damage resulting from, for example, exposure to alkylating agents or ionizing radiation (Section 16.1.1). The process is initiated by a
DNA glycosylase which cleaves the b-N-glycosidic bond between a damaged
base and the sugar component of the nucleotide (Figure 16.22A). Each DNA
glycosylase has a limited specificity (Table 16.3), the specificities of the glycosylases possessed by a cell determining the range of damaged nucleotides that
can be repaired by the base excision pathway. Most organisms are able to deal
with deaminated bases such as uracil (deaminated cytosine) and hypoxanthine (deaminated adenine), oxidation products such as 5-hydroxycytosine
and thymine glycol, and methylated bases such as 3-methyladenine,
7-methylguanine, and 2-methylcytosine. Other DNA glycosylases remove normal bases as part of the mismatch repair system (Section 16.2.3). Most of the
DNA glycosylases involved in base excision repair are thought to diffuse along
the minor groove of the DNA double helix in search of damaged nucleotides,
but some may be associated with the replication enzymes.
A DNA glycosylase removes a damaged base by “flipping” the structure to a
position outside the helix and then detaching it from the polynucleotide. This

creates an AP site, or baseless site, which is converted into a single nucleotide
gap in the second step of the repair pathway (Figure 16.22B). This step can be
carried out in a variety of ways. The standard method makes use of an AP
endonuclease, such as exonuclease III or endonuclease IV of E. coli or APE1
of humans, which cuts the phosphodiester bond on the 5¢ side of the AP site.
Some AP endonucleases can also remove the sugar from the AP site, this
being all that remains of the damaged nucleotide, but others lack this ability
and so work in conjunction with a separate phosphodiesterase. An alternative pathway for converting the AP site into a gap utilizes the endonuclease
activity possessed by some DNA glycosylases, which can make a cut at the 3¢
side of the AP site, probably at the same time that the damaged base is
removed, followed again by removal of the sugar by a phosphodiesterase.

The single nucleotide gap is filled in by a DNA polymerase, using base pairing
with the undamaged base in the other strand of the DNA molecule to ensure
that the correct nucleotide is inserted. In E. coli the gap is filled in by DNA
polymerase I, and in mammals by DNA polymerase b (see Table 15.2). Yeast
seems to be unusual in that it uses its main DNA replicating enzyme, DNA
polymerase d, for this purpose. After gap filling, the final phosphodiester

Nucleotide excision repair has a much broader specificity than the base excision system and is able to deal with more extreme forms of damage such as
intrastrand cross-links and bases that have become modified by attachment
of large chemical groups. It is also able to correct cyclobutyl dimers by a dark
repair process, providing those organisms that do not have the photoreactivation system (such as humans) with a means of repairing this type of
damage.

In nucleotide excision repair, a segment of single-stranded DNA containing
the damaged nucleotide(s) is excised and replaced with new DNA. The
process is therefore similar to base excision repair except that it is not preceded by selective base removal, and a longer stretch of polynucleotide is cut
out. The best-studied example of nucleotide excision repair is the short patch
process of E. coli, so-called because the region of polynucleotide that is
excised and subsequently “patched” is relatively short, usually 12 nucleotides
in length.

Chapter 16 Mutations and DNA Repair

Short patch repair is initiated by a multienzyme complex called the UvrABC
endonuclease, sometimes also referred to as the “excinuclease.” In the first
stage of the process a trimer comprising two UvrA proteins and one copy of
UvrB attaches to the DNA at the damaged site. How the site is recognized is
not known but the broad specificity of the process indicates that individual
types of damage are not directly detected and that the complex must search
for a more general attribute of DNA damage such as distortion of the double
helix. UvrA may be the part of the complex most involved in damage location
because it dissociates once the site has been found and plays no further part
in the repair process. Departure of UvrA allows UvrC to bind (Figure 16.23),
forming a UvrBC dimer that cuts the polynucleotide either side of the damaged site. The first cut is made by UvrB at the fifth phosphodiester bond
downstream of the damaged nucleotide, and the second cut is made by UvrC
at the eighth phosphodiester bond upstream, resulting in the 12-nucleotide
excision, although there is some variability, especially in the position of the
UvrB cut site. The excised segment is then removed, usually as an intact
oligonucleotide, by DNA helicase II, which presumably detaches the segment
by breaking the base pairs holding it to the second strand. UvrC also detaches
at this stage, but UvrB remains in place and bridges the gap produced by the
excision. The bound UvrB is thought to prevent the single-stranded region
that has been exposed from base-pairing with itself, but the role of UvrB
could be to prevent this strand from becoming damaged, or possibly to direct
the DNA polymerase to the site that needs to be repaired. As in base excision
repair, the gap is filled in by DNA polymerase I and the last phosphodiester
bond is synthesized by DNA ligase.

Figure 16.24 Outline of the events
involved during nucleotide excision repair
in eukaryotes. The endonucleases that
remove the damaged region make cuts
specifically at the junction between singlestranded and double-stranded regions of a
DNA molecule. The DNA is therefore
thought to melt either side of the damaged
nucleotide, as shown in the diagram,
possibly as a result of the helicase activity of
TFIIH.

E. coli also has a long patch nucleotide excision repair system that involves
Uvr proteins but differs in that the piece of DNA that is excised can be anything up to 2 kb in length. Long patch repair has been less well studied and
the process is not understood in detail, but it is presumed to work on more
extensive forms of damage, possibly regions where groups of nucleotides,
rather than just individual ones, have become modified. The eukaryotic
nucleotide excision repair process is also called “long patch” but results in
replacement of only 24–29 nucleotides of DNA. In fact, there is no “short
patch” system in eukaryotes and the name “long patch” is used to distinguish
the process from base excision repair. The system is more complex than in E.
coli and the relevant enzymes do not seem to be homologs of the Uvr proteins. In humans, at least 16 proteins are involved, with the downstream cut
being made at the same position as in E. coli—the fifth phosphodiester
bond—but with a more distant upstream cut, resulting in the longer excision.
Both cuts are made by endonucleases that attack single-stranded DNA
specifically at its junction with a double-stranded region, indicating that
before the cuts are made the DNA around the damage site has been melted,
presumably by a helicase (Figure 16.24). This activity is provided at least in
part by TFIIH, one of the components of the RNA polymerase II initiation
complex (see Table 11.5). At first it was assumed that TFIIH simply had a dual
role in the cell, functioning separately in both transcription and repair, but
now it is thought that there is a more direct link between the two processes.
This view is supported by the discovery of transcription-coupled repair,
which repairs some forms of damage in the template strands of genes that are
being actively transcribed. The first type of transcription-coupled repair to be
discovered was a modified version of nucleotide excision, but it is now known
that base excision repair is also coupled with transcription. These discoveries

do not imply that nontranscribed regions of the genome are not repaired. The
excision repair processes protect the entire genome from damage, but it is
entirely logical that special mechanisms should exist for directing the
processes at genes that are being transcribed. The template strands of these
genes contain the genome’s biological information and maintaining their
integrity should be the highest priority for the repair systems.

16.2.3 Mismatch repair: correcting errors of replication
Each of the repair systems that we have looked at so far—direct, base excision, and nucleotide excision repair—recognize and act upon DNA damage
caused by mutagens. This means that they search for abnormal chemical
structures such as modified nucleotides, cyclobutyl dimers, and intrastrand
cross-links. They cannot, however, correct mismatches resulting from errors
in replication because the mismatched nucleotide is not abnormal in any
way, it is simply an A, C, G, or T that has been inserted at the wrong position.
As these nucleotides look exactly like any other nucleotide, the mismatch
repair system that corrects replication errors has to detect not the mismatched nucleotide itself but the absence of base pairing between the parent
and daughter strands. Once it has found a mismatch, the repair system
excises part of the daughter polynucleotide and fills in the gap, in a manner
similar to base and nucleotide excision repair.
The scheme described above leaves one important question unanswered. The
repair must be made in the daughter polynucleotide because it is in this newly
synthesized strand that the error has occurred: the parent polynucleotide has
the correct sequence. How does the repair process know which strand is
which? In E. coli the answer is that the daughter strand is, at this stage, undermethylated and can therefore be distinguished from the parent polynucleotide, which has a full complement of methyl groups. E. coli DNA is methylated because of the activities of the DNA adenine methylase (Dam), which
converts adenines to 6-methyladenines in the sequence 5¢–GATC–3¢, and the
DNA cytosine methylase (Dcm), which converts cytosines to 5-methylcytosines in 5¢–CCAGG–3¢ and 5¢–CCTGG–3¢. These methylations are not mutagenic, the modified nucleotides having the same base-pairing properties as
the unmodified versions. There is a delay between DNA replication and
methylation of the daughter strand, and it is during this window of opportunity that the repair system scans the DNA for mismatches and makes the
required corrections in the undermethylated daughter strand (Figure 16.25).
E. coli has at least three mismatch repair systems, called “long patch,” “short
patch,” and “very short patch,” the names indicating the relative lengths of
the excised and resynthesized segments of DNA. The long patch system
replaces up to a kilobase or more of DNA and requires the MutH, MutL, and
MutS proteins, as well as the DNA helicase II that we met during nucleotide
excision repair. MutS recognizes the mismatch and MutH distinguishes the
two strands by binding to unmethylated 5¢–GATC–3¢ sequences (Figure
16.26). The role of MutL is unclear but it might coordinate the activities of the
other two proteins so that MutH binds to unmethylated 5¢–GATC–3¢
sequences only in the vicinity of mismatch sites recognized by MutS. After
binding, MutH cuts the phosphodiester bond immediately upstream of the G
in the methylation sequence and DNA helicase II detaches the single strand.
There does not appear to be an enzyme that cuts the strand downstream of
the mismatch; instead the detached single-stranded region is degraded by an

exonuclease that follows the helicase and continues beyond the mismatch
site. The gap is then filled in by DNA polymerase I and DNA ligase. Similar
events are thought to occur during short patch and very short patch mismatch repair, the difference being the specificities of the proteins that recognize the mismatch. The short patch system, which results in excision of a segment less than 10 nucleotides in length, begins when MutY recognizes an A–G
or A–C mismatch, and the very short repair system corrects G–T mismatches

Eukaryotes have homologs of the E. coli MutS and MutL proteins and their
mismatch repair processes probably work in a similar way. The one difference
is the absence of a homolog of MutH, which suggests that methylation might
not be the method used to distinguish between the parent and daughter
polynucleotides. Methylation has been implicated in mismatch repair in
mammalian cells, but the DNA of some eukaryotes, including fruit flies and
yeast, is not extensively methylated. It is therefore thought that in these
organisms a different method must be used to identify the daughter strand.
Possibilities include an association between the repair enzymes and the replication complex, so that repair is coupled with DNA synthesis, or use of singlestrand binding proteins that mark the parent strand.

Figure 16.27 Single-strand break repair.

A single-strand break in a double-stranded DNA molecule, such as is produced by some types of oxidative damage, does not present the cell with a
critical problem as the double helix retains its overall intactness. The exposed
single strand is coated with PARP1 proteins, which protect this intact strand
from breaking and prevent it from participating in unwanted recombination
events. The break is then filled in by the enzymes involved in the excision
repair pathways (Figure 16.27).
A double-strand break is more serious because this converts the original double helix into two separate fragments which have to be brought back together
again in order for the break to be repaired. The two broken ends must be protected from further degradation which could result in a deletion mutation
appearing at the repaired break point. The repair processes must also ensure
that the correct ends are joined: if there are two broken chromosomes in the
nucleus, then the correct pairs must be brought together so that the original
structures are restored. Experimental studies of mouse cells indicate that
achieving this outcome is difficult and if two chromosomes are broken then
misrepair resulting in hybrid structures occurs relatively frequently. Even if
only one chromosome is broken, there is still a possibility that a natural chromosome end could be confused as a break and an incorrect repair made. This
type of error is not unknown, despite the presence of special telomerebinding proteins that mark the natural ends of chromosomes (Section 7.1.2).
Double-strand breaks are generated by exposure to ionizing radiation and
some chemical mutagens, and breakages can also occur during DNA replication. Most, if not all, organisms have two distinct pathways for repair of double-strand breaks. The first involves homologous recombination and we will
therefore postpone our examination of it until after we have dealt with the
basic pathway for homologous recombination in Chapter 17. The second system is called nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). Progress in understanding NHEJ has been stimulated by studies of mutant human cell lines, which
have resulted in the identification of various sets of genes involved in the

process. These genes specify a multicomponent protein complex that directs
a DNA ligase to the break (Figure 16.28A). The complex includes two copies of
the Ku protein, one copy attaching to each broken DNA end. Ku proteins can
only bind to cut ends, not to the internal regions of a DNA molecule, because
the DNA molecule must fit into a loop formed by the association between the
two subunits that make up each Ku protein (Figure 16.28B). Individual Ku
proteins have an affinity for one another, which means that the two broken
ends of the DNA molecule are brought into proximity. Ku binds to the DNA in
association with the DNA-PKCS protein kinase, which activates a third protein,
XRCC4, which interacts with the mammalian DNA ligase IV, directing this
repair protein to the double-strand break.
NHEJ was originally thought to be restricted to eukaryotes, but searches of
the protein databases have uncovered bacterial homologs of the mammalian
Ku proteins, and experimental studies have indicated that these act in conjunction with bacterial ligases in a simplified version of the double-strand
break repair process.

16.2.5 Bypassing DNA damage during genome replication
If a region of the genome has suffered extensive damage then it is conceivable
that the repair processes will be overwhelmed. The cell then faces a stark
choice between dying or attempting to replicate the damaged region even
though this replication may be error-prone and result in mutated daughter
molecules. When faced with this choice E. coli cells invariably take the second
option, by inducing one of several emergency procedures for bypassing sites
of major damage.

The SOS response is an emergency measure for coping with a
damaged genome
The best studied of these bypass processes occurs as part of the SOS response,
which enables an E. coli cell to replicate its DNA even though the template

the diagram are also involved in NHEJ.
These include the protein kinases ATM and
ATR (Section 15.3.2), whose main role may
be to signal to the cell the fact that a
double-strand break has occurred and the
cell cycle should be arrested until the break
is repaired. If the cell enters mitosis with a
broken chromosome then part of that
chromosome will be lost, because only one
of the fragments will contain a centromere,
and centromeres are essential for
distribution of chromosomes to the
daughter nuclei during anaphase (see

polynucleotides contain AP sites and/or cyclobutyl dimers and other photoproducts resulting from exposure to chemical mutagens or UV radiation that
would normally block, or at least delay, the replication complex. Bypass of
these sites requires construction of a mutasome, comprising the UmuD¢2C
complex (also called DNA polymerase V, a trimer made up of two UmuD¢ proteins and one copy of UmuC) and several copies of the RecA protein. The latter is primarily a single-strand binding protein that plays many roles in DNA
repair and recombination. In this bypass system, RecA coats the damaged
polynucleotide strands, enabling the UmuD¢2C complex to displace DNA
polymerase III and carry out error-prone DNA synthesis until the damaged
region has been passed and DNA polymerase III can take over once again
(Figure 16.29).
As well as acting as a single-strand binding protein that facilitates the mutasome bypass process, RecA also has a second function as an activator of the
overall SOS response. The protein is stimulated by chemical signals (not yet
identified) that indicate the presence of extensive DNA damage. In response,
RecA cleaves a number of target proteins, directly or indirectly, including
UmuD, the cleavage converting this protein into its active form UmuD¢, and
initiating the mutasome repair process. RecA also cleaves a repressor protein
called LexA, switching on or increasing the expression of a number of genes
normally repressed by LexA, these including both the recA gene itself (leading
to a 50-fold increase in RecA synthesis) and several other genes whose products are involved in DNA repair pathways. RecA also cleaves the cI repressor
of l bacteriophage, so if an integrated l prophage is present in the genome it
can excise and leave the sinking ship (Section 14.3.1).
The SOS response is primarily looked on as the last best chance that the bacterium has to replicate its DNA and hence survive under adverse conditions.
However, the price of survival is an increased mutation rate because the
mutasome does not repair damage, it simply allows a damaged region of a
polynucleotide to be replicated. When it encounters a damaged position in
the template DNA, the polymerase selects a nucleotide more or less at random, although with some preference for placing an A opposite an AP site: in
effect the error rate of the replication process increases. It has been suggested
that this increased mutation rate is the purpose of the SOS response,
mutation being in some way an advantageous response to DNA damage, but
this idea remains controversial.
For some time, the SOS response was thought to be the only damage-bypass
process in bacteria, but we now appreciate that at least two other E. coli polymerases act in a similar way, although with different types of damage. These
are DNA polymerase II, which can bypass nucleotides bound to mutagenic
chemicals such as N-2-acetylaminofluorene, and DNA polymerase IV (also
called DinB), which can replicate through a region of template DNA in which
the two parent polynucleotides have become misaligned. Bypass polymerases
have also been discovered in eukaryotic cells. These include DNA polymerases
e and h, which can bypass cyclobutyl dimers, and DNA polymerases i and z,
which work together to replicate through photoproducts and AP sites.

16.2.6 Defects in DNA repair underlie human diseases,
including cancers
The importance of DNA repair is emphasized by the number and severity of
inherited human diseases that have been linked with defects in one of the

Genomes Chapter 16

Summary

repair processes. One of the best characterized of these is xeroderma pigmentosum, which results from a mutation in any one of several genes for proteins
involved in nucleotide excision repair. Nucleotide excision is the only way in
which human cells can repair cyclobutyl dimers and other photoproducts, so
it is no surprise that the symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum include
hypersensitivity to UV radiation, patients suffering more mutations than normal on exposure to sunlight, and often suffering from skin cancer.
Trichothiodystrophy is also caused by defects in nucleotide excision repair,
but this is a more complex disorder which, although not involving cancer,
usually includes problems with both the skin and nervous system.
A few diseases have been linked with defects in the transcription-coupled
component of nucleotide excision repair. These include breast and ovarian
cancers, the BRCA1 gene that confers susceptibility to these cancers coding
for a protein that has been implicated, at least indirectly, with transcriptioncoupled repair, and Cockayne syndrome, a complex disease manifested by
growth and neurologic disorders. A deficiency in transcription-coupled
repair has also been identified in humans suffering from the cancer-susceptibility syndrome called HNPCC (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer),
although this disease was originally identified as a defect in mismatch repair.
Ataxia telangiectasia, the symptoms of which include sensitivity to ionizing
radiation, results from defects in the ATX gene, which is involved in the
damage-detection process. Other diseases that are associated with a breakdown in DNA repair are Bloom’s and Werner’s syndromes, which are caused
by inactivation of a DNA helicase that may have a role in NHEJ, Fanconi’s
anemia, which confers sensitivity to chemicals that cause cross-links in DNA
but whose biochemical basis is not yet known, and spinocerebellar ataxia,
which results from defects in the pathway used to repair single-strand breaks.

Summary
A mutation is a change in the nucleotide sequence of a DNA molecule, either
a point mutation which affects just a single nucleotide, or an insertion or
deletion of one or more adjacent nucleotides. Mutations can result from
errors made during DNA replication, even though DNA polymerases have
nucleotide-selection processes and proofreading activities that maintain a
high degree of accuracy. These checking mechanisms can, however, be
evaded if an unusual tautomeric version of a nucleotide is present in the
template. A second type of replication error, called slippage, can lead to
insertion or deletion mutations. There are also many types of chemical or
physical agent that can cause mutations. Some compounds act as base
analogs and cause mutations after being mistaken for genuine nucleotides
by the replication machinery. Deaminating and alkylating agents directly
attack DNA molecules, and intercalating agents such as ethidium bromide
slide between base pairs, causing insertions and deletions when the helix is
replicated. UV radiation causes adjacent nucleotides to link together into
dimers, and ionizing radiation and heat cause various types of damage.
Within a gene, a point mutation might have no effect on the coding properties because of the degeneracy of the genetic code, but some mutations will
change the meaning of a codon, so that the codon specifies a different amino
acid or perhaps becomes a termination codon. Insertions and deletions
might cause frameshifts that lead to premature termination or to
readthrough of the correct termination codon. Any of these mutations could

Chapter 16 Mutations and DNA Repair

lead to a loss-of-function mutation, and a few might cause a gain-of-function
mutation, possibly leading to cancer. In bacteria, a mutation might give rise
to an auxotroph, a cell that requires a growth supplement not needed by the
wild type, or to a mutant that displays resistance to an antibiotic or other
inhibitor. The possibility that cells can increase their mutation rates under
some circumstances, or programme mutations in response to environmental changes, is being hotly debated. All cells possess DNA repair processes
that enable many mutations to be corrected. Direct repair systems are
uncommon but the few that are known correct some types of base damage
including removal of UV-induced nucleotide dimers. Excision repair
processes involve excision of a segment of a polynucleotide containing a
damaged site, followed by resynthesis of the correct nucleotide sequence by
a DNA polymerase. Mismatch repair corrects errors of replication, again by
excising a stretch of single-stranded DNA containing the mutation and
repairing the resulting gap. Nonhomologous end-joining is used to mend
double-strand breaks. There are also processes for bypassing sites of DNA
damage during replication, many of these acting as an emergency system for
rescuing a genome that has become heavily mutated.

Give a detailed account of the RecBCD pathway for homologous recombination in Escherichia coli.
Summarize the key features of the RecE and RecF pathways of E. coli, and give the names and
functions of those eukaryotic proteins thought to be involved in homologous recombination.

Briefly discuss the possible ways by which cells minimize the harmful effects of transposition.

Recombination is the term originally used by geneticists to describe the outcome of crossing-over between pairs of homologous chromosomes during
meiosis. Crossing-over results in daughter chromosomes that have different
combinations of alleles compared with their parent chromosomes (Section
3.2.3). In the 1960s, models were proposed for the molecular events that
underlie crossing-over, and it was realized that a key part of molecular recombination is the breakage and subsequent rejoining of DNA molecules.
Biologists now use “recombination” to refer to a variety of processes that
involve the breakage and reunion of polynucleotides. These include:
G

Homologous recombination, also called general (or generalized)
recombination, which occurs between segments of DNA molecules that
share extensive sequence homology. These segments might be present on

different chromosomes, or might be two parts of a single chromosome
(Figure 17.1A). Homologous recombination is responsible for crossingover during meiosis, and was initially studied in this context, but we now
believe that its primary cellular role is in DNA repair.
G

Site-specific recombination, which occurs between DNA molecules that
have only short regions of sequence similarity, possibly just a few base
pairs (Figure 17.1B). Site-specific recombination is responsible for the
insertion of phage genomes, such as that of l, into bacterial chromosomes.

G

Transposition, which results in the transfer of a segment of DNA from one
position in the genome to another (Figure 17.1C).

Various other events that we have studied, including mating-type switching
in yeast (see Figure 14.16) and construction of immunoglobulin genes (see
Figure 14.19), are also the results of recombination.
Without recombination, genomes would be relatively static structures,
undergoing very little change. The gradual accumulation of mutations over a
long period of time would result in small-scale alterations in the nucleotide

sequence of the genome, but more extensive restructuring, which is the role
of recombination, would not occur, and the evolutionary potential of the
genome would be severely restricted.

17.1 Homologous Recombination
The study of homologous recombination has presented two significant challenges for molecular biologists, neither of which has yet been fully met. The
first challenge has been to describe the series of interactions, involving breakage and reunion of polynucleotides, that occur during recombination. The
models for homologous recombination that have resulted from this work are
described in Section 17.1.1. The second challenge relates to the fact that
recombination is a cellular process which, like other cellular processes involving DNA (e.g., transcription and replication), is carried out and regulated by
enzymes and other proteins. Biochemical studies have revealed a series of
related recombination pathways, which are outlined in Section 17.1.2. Work
on these pathways led to the realization that homologous recombination
underlies several important types of DNA repair, this repair function probably
being more important to the cell (especially bacterial cells) than the capacity
that homologous recombination provides for crossing-over between chromosomes. We will examine these repair processes in Section 17.1.3.

17.1.1 Models for homologous recombination
Many of the breakthroughs in understanding homologous recombination
were made by Robin Holliday, Matthew Meselson, and their colleagues in the
1960s and 1970s. This work resulted in a series of models that showed how
breakage and reunion of DNA molecules could lead to the exchange of chromosome segments known to occur during crossing-over. We will therefore
begin our study of homologous recombination by examining these models.

The Holliday and Meselson–Radding models for homologous
recombination
These models describe recombination between two homologous, doublestranded molecules, ones with identical or nearly identical sequences. The
central feature of these models is formation of a heteroduplex resulting from
the exchange of polynucleotide segments between the two homologous molecules (Figure 17.2). The heteroduplex is initially stabilized by base-pairing
between each transferred strand and the intact polynucleotides of the recipient molecules, this base pairing being possible because of the sequence similarity between the two molecules. Subsequently the gaps are sealed by DNA
ligase, giving a Holliday structure. This structure is dynamic, branch migration resulting in exchange of longer segments of DNA if the two helices rotate
in the same direction.
Separation, or resolution, of the Holliday structure back into individual, double-stranded molecules occurs by cleavage across the branch point. This is
the key to the entire process because the cut can be made in either of two orientations, as becomes apparent when the three-dimensional configuration,
or chi form, of the Holliday structure is examined (see Figure 17.2). These two
cuts have very different results. If the cut is made left–right across the chi
form as drawn in Figure 17.2, then all that happens is that a short segment of
polynucleotide, corresponding to the distance migrated by the branch of the
Holliday structure, is transferred between the two molecules. On the other

hand, an up–down cut results in reciprocal strand exchange, doublestranded DNA being transferred between the two molecules so that the end
of one molecule is exchanged for the end of the other molecule. This is the
DNA transfer seen in crossing-over.
So far we have ignored one aspect of this model. This is the way in which the
two double-stranded molecules interact at the beginning of the process to
produce the heteroduplex. In Holliday’s original scheme, the two molecules
lined up with one another and single-strand nicks appeared at equivalent
positions in each helix. This produced free, single-stranded ends that could
be exchanged, resulting in the heteroduplex (Figure 17.3A). This feature of the
model was criticized because no mechanism could be proposed for ensuring
that the nicks occurred at precisely the same position on each molecule. The
Meselson–Radding modification proposes a more satisfactory scheme
whereby a single-strand nick occurs in just one of the double helices, the free
end that is produced “invading” the unbroken double helix at the homologous position and displacing one of its strands, forming a D-loop (Figure
17.3B). Subsequent cleavage of the displaced strand at the junction between
its single-stranded and base-paired regions produces the heteroduplex.

The double-strand break model for homologous recombination
Although the Holliday model for homologous recombination, either in its
original form or as modified by Meselson and Radding, explained how crossing-over could occur during meiosis, it had inadequacies which prompted
the development of alternative schemes. In particular, it was thought that the
Holliday model could not explain gene conversion, a phenomenon first
described in yeast and fungi but now known to occur with many eukaryotes.
In yeast, fusion of a pair of gametes results in a zygote that gives rise to an
ascus containing four haploid spores whose genotypes can be individually
determined (see Figure 14.15). If the gametes have different alleles at a particular locus then under normal circumstances two of the spores will display
one genotype and two will display the other genotype, but sometimes this
expected 2:2 segregation pattern is replaced by an unexpected 3:1 ratio
(Figure 17.4). This is called gene conversion because the ratio can only be
explained by one of the alleles “converting” from one type to the other, presumably by recombination during the meiosis that occurs after the gametes
have fused.
The double-strand break (DSB) model provides an opportunity for gene conversion to take place during recombination. According to this model, homologous recombination initiates not with a single-strand nick, as in the
Meselson–Radding scheme, but with a double-strand cut that breaks one of
the partners in the recombination into two pieces (Figure 17.5). After the
double-strand cut, one strand in each half of the molecule is shortened, so
each end now has a 3¢ overhang. One of these overhangs invades the homologous DNA molecule in a manner similar to that envisaged by the
Meselson–Radding scheme, setting up a Holliday junction that can migrate
along the heteroduplex if the invading strand is extended by a DNA polymerase. To complete the heteroduplex, the other broken strand (the one not
involved in the Holliday junction) is also extended. Note that both DNA syntheses involve extension of strands from the partner that suffered the doublestrand cut, using as templates the equivalent regions of the uncut partner.
This is the basis of the gene conversion because it means that the polynucleotide segments removed from the cut partner have been replaced with
copies of the DNA from the uncut partner. After ligation, the resulting heteroduplex has a pair of Holliday structures that can be resolved in a number

Although initially proposed as a mechanism for explaining gene conversion
in yeast, the DSB model is now looked on as at least a close approximation to
the way in which homologous recombination operates in all organisms.
Acceptance of this model has come about for two reasons. First, in 1989 it was
discovered that during meiosis chromosomes undergo double-strand breakages at 100–1000 times the rate seen in vegetative cells. The implication that
formation of double-strand breaks is an inherent part of meiosis clearly
favors the DSB model at the expense of schemes in which recombination is
initiated by one or more single-strand nicks. The second factor leading to
acceptance of the DSB model was the realization that homologous recombination is involved in DNA repair, and specifically is responsible for repairing
double-strand breaks that occur as aberrations in the replication process. The
Holliday and Meselson–Radding models do not explain this aspect of homologous recombination, whereas double-strand break repair is implicit in the
DSB model. We return to the role of homologous recombination in DNA
repair in Section 17.1.3.

17.1.2 The biochemistry of homologous recombination
Homologous recombination occurs in all organisms but, as with many
aspects of molecular biology, the initial progress in understanding how the
process is carried out in the cell was made with E. coli. Mutation studies have
identified a number of E. coli genes that, when inactivated, give rise to defects
in homologous recombination, indicating that their protein products are
involved in the process in some way. Three distinct recombination systems
have been described, these being the RecBCD, RecE, and RecF pathways, with
RecBCD apparently being the most important in the bacterium.

Figure 17.5 The double-strand break
model for homologous recombination.
This model explains how gene conversion
can occur.

In the RecBCD pathway, recombination is mediated by the RecBCD enzyme
which, as its name implies, is made up of three different proteins. Two of
these—RecB and RecD—are helicases. To initiate homologous recombination,
one copy of the RecBCD enzyme attaches to the free ends of a chromosome at
a double-strand break. The DNA is unwound from each end, through the
action of RecB, which travels along one strand in the 3¢Æ5¢ direction, and
RecD, traveling 5¢Æ3¢ along the other strand. The RecB protein, as well as being
a helicase, also has 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity and so progressively degrades
the strand it is traveling along—the one with the free 3¢ end (Figure 17.6).
RecBCD progresses along the DNA molecule at a rate of approximately 1 kb
per second until it reaches the first copy of the eight-nucleotide consensus
sequence 5¢–GCTGGTGG–3¢ called the chi site, which occurs on average once
every 6 kb in E. coli DNA. At the chi site, the conformation of RecBCD
changes so that the RecD helicase becomes uncoupled and the progress of the
RecBCD complex slows to about half its initial rate. Exactly what happens next
is unclear, but according to the most recent model, the change in conformation of the enzyme also reduces, or completely abolishes, the 3¢Æ5¢ exonuclease activity of RecB, this protein now making a single endonucleolytic cut in
the other strand of the DNA molecule, at a position close to the chi site (see
Figure 17.6). Whatever the precise mechanism, the result is that the RecBCD

Genomes Chapter 17

enzyme produces a double-stranded molecule with a 3¢ overhang, exactly as
envisaged by the DSB model (see second panel of Figure 17.5).

Progression of RecBCD along a DNA molecule
chi site

The next step is establishment of the heteroduplex. This stage is mediated by
the RecA protein, which forms a protein-coated DNA filament that is able to
invade the intact double helix and set up the D-loop (Figure 17.7). An intermediate in formation of the D-loop is a triplex structure (see third panel of
Figure 17.5), a three-stranded DNA helix in which the invading polynucleotide lies within the major groove of the intact helix and forms hydrogen
bonds with the base pairs it encounters.
Branch migration is catalyzed by the RuvA and RuvB proteins, both of which
attach to the branch point of the heteroduplex formed by invasion of the 3¢
overhang into the partner molecule. X-ray crystallography studies suggest
that four copies of RuvA bind directly to the branch, forming a core to which
two RuvB rings (each consisting of eight proteins) attach, one to either side
(Figure 17.8). The resulting structure might act as a “molecular motor,” rotating the helices in the required manner so that the branch point moves.
Branch migration does not appear to be a random process, but instead stops
preferentially at the sequence 5¢–(A/T)TT(G/C)–3¢ (where (A/T) etc. denotes
that either of two nucleotides can be present at the position indicated). This
sequence occurs frequently in the E. coli genome, so presumably migration
does not always halt at the first instance of the motif that is reached. When
branch migration has ended, the RuvAB complex detaches and is replaced by
two RuvC proteins (see Figure 17.8) which carry out the cleavage that resolves
the Holliday structure. The cuts are made between the second T and the
(G/C) components of the recognition sequence.
Note that the above description provides no precise role for the RecC protein
in homologous recombination by the RecBCD pathway. RecC is, in fact,
rather enigmatic as its amino acid sequence is dissimilar from that of any
other protein synthesized by E. coli. Recent X-ray crystallography studies
have shown that the tertiary structure of RecC resembles that of the SF1 family of helicases. The amino acids that are central to the helicase activity are
absent from RecC, although the equivalent region of the RecC protein still
makes contact with the DNA molecule. It seems unlikely that RecC possesses
any residual helicase activity, and it therefore does not aid RecB and RecD in
unwinding the double helix, but one possibility is that RecC has acquired a
scanning function and is responsible for identifying the chi site and hence
initiating the conformational change in RecBCD that leads to formation of
the heteroduplex.

Other homologous recombination pathways in E. coli
Mutants of E. coli that lack components of the RecBCD system are still able to
carry out homologous recombination, albeit with lowered efficiency. This is
because the bacterium possesses at least two other homologous recombination pathways, called RecE and RecF. In normal E. coli cells most homologous
recombination takes place via RecBCD, but if this pathway is inactivated by
mutation the RecE system is able to take over, to be replaced by RecF when
RecE is inactivated.
The details of the RecF pathway are beginning to emerge, and the general
mechanism appears to be similar to that described for RecBCD. The helicase

activity for the RecF pathway is provided by RecQ, and the 5¢ end of the strand
is removed by RecJ, leaving a 3¢ overhang which becomes coated in RecA proteins through the combined actions of RecF, RecJ, RecO, RecQ, and RecR.
There is considerable interchangeability between the components of the
RecBCD and RecF pathways, and it is thought that hybrid systems operate in
some mutants that lack one or other components of the standard processes.
There are differences, however, as only the RecBCD pathway initiates recombination at the chi sites scattered around the E. coli genome, and only RecF is
able to induce recombination between a pair of plasmids. RecF is also the primary pathway responsible for recombination repair of single-strand gaps
resulting from replication of heavily damaged DNA (Section 17.1.3). The RecE
pathway is much less well studied but the indications are that it has substantial overlap with the RecF system, with RecJ, RecO, RecQ, and RecF itself
appearing to be common to both pathways.

As well as the RecBCD, RecE, and RecF variants, whose functions are to set up
the heteroduplex structure, E. coli also has alternative means for carrying out
the branch migration step. Mutants that lack RuvA or RuvB are still able to
carry out homologous recombination because the function of RuvAB can also
be provided by a helicase called RecG. It is not yet clear whether RuvAB and
RecG are simply interchangeable or if they are specific for different recombination scenarios. RuvC mutants are also able to carry out homologous
recombination, suggesting that E. coli possesses other proteins that are able
to resolve Holliday structures, but the identity of these protein(s) is unknown.

The double-strand break model for homologous recombination is thought to
hold for all organisms, not just E. coli—recall that it was initially devised to
explain gene conversion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Section 17.1.1). The
biochemical events underlying the process appear to be similar in all organisms, and a number of yeast proteins have been identified that carry out functions equivalent to those occurring during the RecBCD pathway in E. coli. In
particular, two yeast proteins called RAD51 and DMC1 are the homologs of
RecA of E. coli. Although specific roles for RAD51 and DMC1 are suspected,
they are thought to work together in many homologous recombination
events. This conclusion arises because mutants that lack one or other protein
have similar phenotypes, and the two proteins are found together at the same
locations within nuclei that are undergoing meiosis. Interestingly, there are

Genomes Chapter 17

about 100 recombination hotspots in the S. cerevisiae genome (Section 3.2.3),
suggesting that sequences equivalent to E. coli chi sites might be present,
albeit at a lower frequency—one per 40 kb in the yeast genome compared
with one per 6 kb for E. coli. Proteins homologous to RAD51 and DMC1 are
also known in several other eukaryotes including humans.
One puzzling aspect of homologous recombination in eukaryotes has been
the mechanism by which Holliday structures are resolved, because for many
years proteins homologous to E. coli RuvC have been sought but not found.
In fact, RuvC is not universal in all bacteria, some species apparently using a
totally different type of nuclease to resolve Holliday structures. In the
archaea, the equivalent function is thought to be performed by the Hjc protein, which has no sequence homology with RuvC but has been shown, by
biochemical tests, to bind to Holliday structures. Several eukaryotic proteins
have been identified which have structural similarity with Hjc, including
RAD51C of S. cerevisiae, which is a member of the RAD51 multigene family,
and Mus81 of humans. Models have also been proposed for resolving
Holliday structures by a combination of helicase and topoisomerase activity,
these models suggesting that direct RuvC equivalents might not be needed in
all eukaryotes.

17.1.3 Homologous recombination and DNA repair
The attention paid by geneticists to crossing-over as a central feature of sexual reproduction inevitably biased the initial studies of homologous recombination toward events occurring during meiosis. An alternative role for
homologous recombination became apparent when E. coli mutants defective for components of the RecBCD and other recombination pathways were
first examined and shown to have deficiencies in DNA repair. Today we
believe that the principal function of homologous recombination is in
postreplicative repair, its role in crossing-over being of secondary importance in most cells.
Postreplicative repair occurs when breaks arise in daughter DNA molecules
as a result of aberrations in the replication process. One such aberration can
occur when the replication machinery is attempting to copy a segment of the
genome that is heavily damaged, in particular regions in which cyclobutyl
dimers are prevalent. When a cyclobutyl dimer is encountered, the template
strand cannot be copied and the DNA polymerase simply jumps ahead to the
nearest undamaged region, where it restarts the replication process. The
result is that one of the daughter polynucleotides has a gap (Figure 17.9). One
way in which this gap could be repaired is by a recombination event that
transfers the equivalent segment of DNA from the parent polynucleotide
present in the second daughter double helix. The gap that is now present in
the second double helix is refilled by a DNA polymerase, using the undamaged daughter polynucleotide within this helix as the template. In E. coli, this
type of single-strand gap repair utilizes the RecF recombination pathway.
If the damaged site cannot be bypassed then the daughter polynucleotide,
rather than having a gap, will terminate (Figure 17.10). There are several ways
in which this gap could be repaired. One possibility is that the replication fork
stalls and reverses a short distance, so that a duplex is formed between the
daughter polynucleotides. The incomplete polynucleotide is then extended
by a DNA polymerase, using the undamaged daughter strand as a template.

The replication fork then moves forward again, by a process equivalent to the

A more serious aberration occurs if one of the parent polynucleotides being
replicated contains a single-strand nick. Now the replication process leads to
a double-strand break in one of the daughter double helices, and the replication fork is lost (Figure 17.11). The break can be repaired by a form of
homologous recombination between the broken end and the second,
undamaged molecule. In the scheme shown in Figure 17.11, the daughter
polynucleotide at the double-strand break is extended via a strand exchange
reaction which enables it to use the other parent strand as a template. Branch
migration followed by resolution of the Holliday structure then restores the
replication fork.

17.2 Site-Specific Recombination

Resolution of
Holliday structure

A region of extensive homology is not a prerequisite for recombination: the
process can also be initiated between two DNA molecules that have only very
short sequences in common. This is called site-specific recombination and it
has been extensively studied because of the part that it plays during the infection cycle of bacteriophage l.

att sites present in bacteriophage l and
in the E. coli chromosome. The red line
indicates the staggered cut made in each
att site during integration and excision of
the phage genome.

After injecting its DNA into an E. coli cell, bacteriophage l can follow either
of two infection pathways (Section 14.3.1). One of these, the lytic pathway,
results in the rapid synthesis of l coat proteins, combined with replication of
the l genome, leading to death of the bacterium and release of new phages
within about 45 minutes of the initial infection. In contrast, if the phage follows the lysogenic pathway, new phages do not immediately appear. The bacterium divides as normal, possibly for many cell divisions, with the phage in
a quiescent form called the prophage. Eventually, possibly as the result of
DNA damage or some other stimulus, the phage becomes active again.
During the lysogenic phase the l genome becomes integrated into the E. coli
chromosome. It is therefore replicated whenever the E. coli DNA is copied,
and is passed on to daughter cells just as though it was a standard part of the
bacterium’s genome. Integration occurs by site-specific recombination
between the attachment or att sites, attP on the l genome and attB on the E.
coli chromosome. Each of these attachment sites has at its center an identical 15 bp core sequence referred to as O (Figure 17.12), flanked by variable
sequences called B and B¢ in the bacterial genome and P and P¢ in the phage
DNA. B and B¢ are quite short, just 4 bp each, meaning that attB covers just
23 bp of DNA, but P and P¢ are much longer with the entire attP sequence
spanning over 250 bp. Mutations in the core sequence inevitably lead to
inactivation of the att site so that it can no longer participate in recombination, but mutations in the flanking sequences have a less severe consequence
and only decrease the efficiency of recombination. If attB, the attachment site
in the E. coli genome, is inactivated then insertion of the l DNA can occur at
secondary sites which share some sequence similarity with the genuine attB
locus. If a secondary site is being used then the frequency of lysogeny is
greatly reduced, integration possibly occurring at less than 0.01% of the frequency observed with unmutated E. coli cells.

Because this is recombination between two circular molecules, the result is
that one bigger circle is formed: in other words, the l DNA becomes integrated into the bacterial genome (Figure 17.13). The recombination event is
catalyzed by a specialized Type I topoisomerase (Section 15.1.2) called integrase, a member of a diverse family of recombinases present in bacteria,
archaea, and yeast. There are at least four binding sites for integrase within
attP, as well as at least three sites for a second protein, the integration host
factor, or IHF. Together these proteins coat the phage attachment site. The
integrase then makes a staggered, double-strand cut at equivalent positions
in the l and bacterial att sites. The two short, single-strand overhangs are
then exchanged between the DNA molecules, producing a Holliday junction
which migrates a few base pairs along the heteroduplex before being cleaved.
This cleavage, providing that it is made in the appropriate orientation,
resolves the Holliday structure in such a way that the l DNA becomes
inserted into the E. coli genome.
Integration creates hybrid versions of the attachment sites, which are now
called attR (which has the structure BOP¢) and attL (whose structure is POB¢).
A second site-specific recombination between the two att sites, now both
contained in the same molecule, reverses the original process and releases the
l DNA. This recombination is also catalyzed by the integrase, but in conjunction with a protein called “excisionase,” coded by the l xis gene, rather than
IHF. The functions of Xis and IHF in, respectively, excision and integration are
probably quite different, and the two proteins should not be looked on as
playing equivalent roles in the two processes. The key point is that the combination of integrase and excisionase is able to draw the attR and attL sites
together in order to initiate the intramolecular recombination that excises the
l genome. After excision, the l genome returns to the lytic mode of infection
and directs synthesis of new phages.

17.2.2 Site-specific recombination is an aid in genetic
engineering
The processes responsible for integration and excision of the l genome are
fairly typical of the strategies used by phages to establish lysogeny, though
with some phages the molecular events are less complex than those seen with
l. Integration and excision of the bacteriophage P1 genome, for example,

requires just a single enzyme, the Cre recombinase, which recognizes 34 bp
target sites, called loxB and loxP, which are identical to one another and have
no flanking sequences equivalent to B, B¢, and so forth.
The simplicity of the P1 system has led to its utilization in genetic engineering projects in which site-specific recombination is a requirement. An important application has arisen in the technology used for the generation of
genetically modified crops. One of the main areas of concern to emerge from
the debate over genetically modified plants is the possible harmful effects of
the marker genes used with plant cloning vectors. Most plant vectors carry a
copy of a gene for kanamycin resistance (see Figure 2.27), enabling transformed plants to be identified during the cloning process. The kanR gene is
bacterial in origin and codes for the enzyme neomycin phosphotransferase
II. This gene and its enzyme product are present in all cells of an engineered
plant. The fear that neomycin phosphotransferase might be toxic to humans
has been allayed by tests with animal models, but there are still concerns that
the kanR gene contained in a genetically modified foodstuff could be passed
to bacteria in the human gut, making these resistant to kanamycin and
related antibiotics, or that the kanR gene could be passed to other organisms
in the environment, possibly resulting in damage to the ecosystem.
The fears surrounding the use of kanR and other marker genes have
prompted biotechnologists to devise ways of removing these genes from
plant DNA after the transformation event has been verified. One of the strategies makes use of Cre recombinase. To use this system the plant is transformed with two cloning vectors, the first carrying the gene being added to
the plant along with its kanR selectable marker gene surrounded by the lox
target sequences, and the second carrying the Cre recombinase gene. After
transformation, expression of the Cre gene therefore results in excision of the
kanR gene from the plant DNA (Figure 17.14).

17.3 Transposition
Transposition is not a type of recombination but a process that often utilizes
recombination, the end result being the transfer of a segment of DNA from
one position in the genome to another. A characteristic feature of transposition is that the transferred segment is flanked by a pair of short direct repeats
(Figure 17.15) which are formed during the transposition process.
Chromosomal DNA

In Section 9.2 we examined the various types of transposable element known
in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and discovered that these could be broadly
divided into three categories on the basis of their transposition mechanism:

Transposon
CTGG

CTGG

G

DNA transposons that transpose replicatively, the original transposon
remaining in place and a new copy appearing elsewhere in the genome
(Figure 17.16).

G

DNA transposons that transpose conservatively, the original transposon
moving to a new site by a cut-and-paste process.

G

Retroelements, all of which transpose replicatively via an RNA intermediate.

Direct repeats

Figure 17.15 Integrated transposable
elements are flanked by short direct
repeat sequences. This particular
transposon is flanked by the tetranucleotide
repeat 5¢–CTGG–3¢. Other transposons
have different direct repeat sequences.

We will now examine the recombination events that are responsible for each
of these three types of transposition.

17.3.1 Replicative and conservative transposition of DNA
transposons
A number of models for replicative and conservative transposition of DNA
transposons have been proposed over the years but most are modifications of
a scheme originally outlined by Shapiro in 1979. According to this model, the
replicative transposition of a bacterial element such as a Tn3-type transposon
or a transposable phage (Section 9.2.2) is initiated by one or more endonucleases that make single-strand cuts either side of the transposon and in the
target site where the new copy of the element will be inserted (Figure 17.17).
At the target site the two cuts are separated by a few base pairs, so that the
cleaved double-stranded molecule has short 5¢ overhangs.
Ligation of these 5¢ overhangs to the free 3¢ ends either side of the transposon
produces a hybrid molecule in which the original two DNAs—the one containing the transposon and the one containing the target site—are linked
together by the transposable element flanked by a pair of structures resembling replication forks. DNA synthesis at these replication forks copies the
transposable element and converts the initial hybrid into a cointegrate, in
which the two original DNAs are still linked. Homologous recombination
between the two copies of the transposon uncouples the cointegrate, separating the original DNA molecule (with its copy of the transposon still in
place) from the target molecule, which now contains a copy of the transposon. Replicative transposition has therefore occurred.
A modification of the process just described changes the mode of transposition from replicative to conservative (see Figure 17.17). Rather than carrying
out DNA synthesis, the hybrid structure is converted back into two separate
DNA molecules simply by making additional single-strand nicks either side of
the transposon. This cuts the transposon out of its original molecule, leaving
it “pasted” into the target DNA.

17.3.2 Transposition of retroelements
From the human perspective, the most important retroelements are the retroviruses, which include the human immunodeficiency viruses that cause AIDS
and various other virulent types. Most of what we know about retrotransposition
refers specifically to retroviruses, although it is believed that other retroelements, such as retrotransposons of the Ty1/copia and Ty3/gypsy families,
transpose by similar mechanisms. These mechanisms do not involve recombination but, for convenience, we will consider them here.
The first step in retrotransposition is synthesis of an RNA copy of the inserted
retroelement (Figure 17.18). The long terminal repeat (LTR) at the 5¢ end of the
element contains a TATA sequence which acts as a promoter for transcription
by RNA polymerase II (Section 11.2.2). Some retroelements also have
enhancer sequences (Section 11.3) that are thought to regulate the amount of

553

Figure 17.16 Replicative and conservative
transposition. DNA transposons use either
the replicative or conservative pathway
(some can use both). Retroelements
transpose replicatively via an RNA
intermediate.

transcription that occurs. Transcription continues through the entire length of
the element, up to a polyadenylation sequence (Section 12.2.1) in the 3¢ LTR.
The transcript now acts as the template for RNA-dependent DNA synthesis,
catalyzed by a reverse transcriptase enzyme coded by part of the pol gene of
the retroelement (see Figure 9.14). Because this is synthesis of DNA, a primer
is required (Section 15.2.2) and, as during genome replication, the primer is
made of RNA rather than DNA. During genome replication, the primer is synthesized de novo by a polymerase enzyme (see Figure 15.13), but retroelements do not code for RNA polymerases and so cannot make primers in this

way. Instead they use one of the cell’s tRNA molecules as a primer, which one
depending on the retroelement: the Ty1/copia family of elements always use
tRNAMet but other retroelements use different tRNAs.
The tRNA primer anneals to a site within the 5¢ LTR (see Figure 17.18). At first
glance this appears to be a strange location for the priming site because it
means that DNA synthesis is directed away from the central region of the

retroelement and so results in only a short copy of part of the 5¢ LTR. In fact,
when the DNA copy has been extended to the end of the LTR, a part of the
RNA template is degraded and the DNA overhang that is produced reanneals
to the 3¢ LTR of the retroelement which, being a long terminal repeat, has the
same sequence as the 5¢ LTR and so can base-pair with the DNA copy. DNA
synthesis now continues along the RNA template, eventually displacing the
tRNA primer. Note that the result is a DNA copy of the entire template, including the priming site: the template switching is, in effect, the strategy that the
retroelement uses to solve the “end-shortening” problem, the same problem
that chromosomal DNAs address through telomere synthesis (Section 15.2.4).
Completion of synthesis of the first DNA strand results in a DNA–RNA hybrid.
The RNA is partially degraded by an RNase H enzyme, coded by another part
of the pol gene. The RNA that is not degraded, usually just a single fragment
attached to a short polypurine sequence adjacent to the 3¢ LTR, primes synthesis of the second DNA strand, again by reverse transcriptase, which is able
to act as both an RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. As with the
first round of DNA synthesis, second-strand synthesis initially results in a
DNA copy of just the LTR, but a second template switch, to the other end of
the molecule, enables the DNA copy to be extended until it is full length. This
creates a template for further extension of the first DNA strand, so that the
resulting double-stranded DNA is a complete copy of the internal region of
the retroelement plus the two LTRs.
All that remains is to insert the new copy of the retroelement into the genome.
It was originally thought that insertion occurred randomly, but it now
appears that although no particular sequence is used as a target site, integration occurs preferentially at certain positions. Insertion involves removal of
two nucleotides from the 3¢ ends of the double-stranded retroelement by the
integrase enzyme (coded by yet another part of pol). The integrase also makes
a staggered cut in the genomic DNA so that both the retroelement and the
integration site now have 5¢ overhangs (Figure 17.19). These overhangs might
not have complementary sequences but they still appear to interact in some
way so that the retroelement becomes inserted into the genomic DNA. The
interaction results in loss of the retroelement overhangs and filling in of the
gaps that are left, which means that the integration site becomes duplicated
into a pair of direct repeats, one at either end of the inserted retroelement.

17.3.3 How do cells minimize the harmful effect of
transposition?
Transposition can have deleterious effects on a genome. These effects go
beyond the obvious disruption of gene activity that will occur if a transposable element takes up a new position that lies within the coding region of a
gene. Some elements, notably retrotransposons, contain promoter and
enhancer sequences that can modify the expression patterns of adjacent
genes, and transposition often involves the creation of double-strand breaks
which, as we saw in Section 16.2.4, can have seriously harmful effects on the
integrity of a genome. Interspersed repeats, at least some of which are mobile,
make up almost half of each mammalian genome and a substantially larger
fraction of some plant genomes. It might therefore be expected that these and
other genomes have evolved mechanisms for limiting the movement of their
transposable elements.

Summary

One way in which transposition of both DNA transposons and retroelements
could be prevented is by methylation of their DNA sequences, methylation
being a common means of silencing genomic regions (Section 10.3.1). Many
transposable element sequences are indeed hypermethylated—90% of the
methylated cytosines in the human genome are located in the interspersed
repeat sequences—but experimental evidence linking this methylation with
suppression of transposition has been difficult to obtain. Recently it has
been shown that mutants of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana that have deficient methylation systems suffer from a higher than normal amount of transposition, but this heightened transposition might not be displayed by all
types of transposon in the plant genome. Further work is underway to
explore the role of methylation in Arabidopsis and to extend the studies to
other types of organism.

Summary
Recombination was originally used to describe the outcome of crossing-over
between pairs of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. The term is now
also used to refer to the molecular events which underlie this process.
Homologous recombination occurs between segments of DNA molecules
that share extensive sequence homology. The initial models for homologous
recombination envisaged the recombination process being initiated by nicks
that occur in one or both of the double-stranded molecules, but it is now
thought that the start point is a double-strand break in one of these molecules. Strand exchange leads to a heteroduplex structure which is resolved by
cleavage, possibly leading to exchange of DNA segments or to gene conversion. Escherichia coli possesses at least three molecular pathways for homologous recombination. The one that has been studied in greatest detail, the
RecBCD pathway, involves the unwinding of one partner in the recombination by a pair of helicases, which attach to the double-strand break and
progress along the molecule. At a recognition sequence called a chi site the
RecBCD complex initiates the strand exchange, with the RecA protein playing
a central role in transfer of the invading strand into the intact double helix.
Branch migration within the heteroduplex, and resolution of the structure, is
catalyzed by the Ruv proteins. The RecE and RecF pathways operate in similar ways, with a number of proteins shared between the three recombination
systems. Equivalent proteins are known in eukaryotes. Homologous recombination is responsible for postreplicative repair of DNA breaks. Site-specific
recombination does not require regions of extensive homology between the
partner molecules. This type of recombination is responsible for insertion of
bacteriophage genomes, such as the l genome, into the host bacterial chromosome. Integration of the l genome into E. coli DNA occurs by recombination between a pair of 15 bp sequences contained within longer attachment
sites. Integration requires the integrase coded by the l genome and the E. coli
integration host factor. Excision requires the integrase and an excisionase
protein. Transposition of DNA transposons occurs by recombination. The
process can be either replicative or conservative, both occurring by a series of
events initially described by Shapiro in 1979. Retroelements transpose via an
RNA intermediate which is transcribed from the parent copy of the transposon. After copying into double-stranded DNA, the retroelement is reinserted
into the host chromosome.

Explain how new genes can arise by domain duplication and domain shuffling.
Assess the likely impact of lateral gene transfer on genome evolution in bacteria and in eukaryotes.
Outline how transposable elements may have influenced genome evolution.

Mutation and recombination provide the genome with the means to evolve,
but we learn very little about the evolutionary histories of genomes simply by
studying these events in living cells. Instead we must combine our understanding of mutation and recombination with comparisons between the
genomes of different organisms in order to infer the patterns of genome evolution that have occurred. Clearly, this approach is imprecise and uncertain
but, as we will see, it is based on a surprisingly large amount of hard data and
we can be reasonably confident that, at least in outline, the picture that
emerges is not too far from the truth.

Chapter 18 How Genomes Evolve

In this chapter we will explore the evolution of genomes from the very origins of
biochemical systems through to the present day. We will look at ideas regarding
the RNA world, prior to the appearance of the first DNA molecules, and then
examine how DNA genomes have gradually become more complex. Finally, in
Section 18.4 we will compare the human genome with the genome of the chimpanzee in order to identify the evolutionary changes that have occurred during
the last five million years and which must, somehow, make us what we are.

18.1 Genomes: the First Ten Billion Years
Cosmologists believe that the universe began some 14 billion years ago with
the gigantic “primordial fireball” called the Big Bang. Mathematical models
suggest that after about 4 billion years galaxies began to fragment from the
clouds of gas emitted by the Big Bang, and that within our own galaxy the
solar nebula condensed to form the Sun and its planets about 4.6 billion years
ago (Figure 18.1). The early Earth was covered with water and it was in this
vast planetary ocean that the first biochemical systems appeared, cellular life
being well established by the time land masses began to appear, some 3.5 billion years ago. But cellular life was a relatively late stage in biochemical evolution, being preceded by self-replicating polynucleotides that were the progenitors of the first genomes. We must begin our study of genome evolution
with these precellular systems.

Genomes: the First Ten Billion Years

18.1.1 The origins of genomes
The first oceans are thought to have had a similar salt composition to those of
today but the Earth’s atmosphere, and hence the dissolved gases in the oceans,
was very different. The oxygen content of the atmosphere remained very low
until photosynthesis evolved, and to begin with the most abundant gases were
probably methane and ammonia. Experiments attempting to recreate the
conditions in the ancient atmosphere have shown that electrical discharges in
a methane–ammonia mixture result in chemical synthesis of a range of amino
acids, including alanine, glycine, valine, and several of the others found in proteins. Hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde are also formed, these participating in additional reactions to give other amino acids, as well as purines, pyrimidines, and, in less abundance, sugars. At least some of the building blocks of
biomolecules could therefore have accumulated in the ancient chemosphere.

The first biochemical systems were centered on RNA
Polymerization of the building blocks into biomolecules might have occurred
in the oceans or could have been promoted by the repeated condensation
and drying of droplets of water in clouds. Alternatively, polymerization might
have taken place on solid surfaces, perhaps making use of monomers immobilized on clay particles, or in hydrothermal vents. The precise mechanism
need not concern us: what is important is that it is possible to envisage purely
geochemical processes that could lead to synthesis of polymeric biomolecules similar to the ones found in living systems. It is the next steps that we
must worry about. We have to go from a random collection of biomolecules
to an ordered assemblage that displays at least some of the biochemical properties that we associate with life. These steps have never been reproduced
experimentally and our ideas are therefore based mainly on speculation tempered by a certain amount of computer simulation. One problem is that the
speculations are unconstrained because the global ocean could have contained as many as 1010 biomolecules per liter and we can allow a billion years
for the necessary events to take place. This means that even the most improbable scenarios cannot be dismissed out of hand.
Progress in understanding the origins of life was initially stalled by the apparent requirement that polynucleotides and polypeptides must work in harness
in order to produce a self-reproducing biochemical system. This is because
proteins are required to catalyze biochemical reactions but cannot carry out
their own self-replication. Polynucleotides can specify the synthesis of proteins and self-replicate, but it was thought that they could do neither without
the aid of proteins. It appeared that the biochemical system would have to
spring fully formed from the random collection of biomolecules because any
intermediate stage could not be perpetuated. The major breakthrough came
in the mid-1980s when it was discovered that RNA can have catalytic activity.
Those ribozymes that are known today carry out three types of biochemical
reaction:
G

Self-cleavage, as displayed by the self-splicing Group I, II, and III introns
and by some virus genomes (Table 12.4 and Section 12.2.4).

G

Cleavage of other RNAs, as carried out by, for example, RNase P (Table 12.4
and Section 12.1.3).

G

Synthesis of peptide bonds, carried out by the rRNA component of the
ribosome (Section 13.2.3).

of RNA polymerases, ribonucleotides that
became associated with an RNA template
would have had to polymerize
spontaneously. This process would have
been inaccurate and many RNA sequences
would have been generated

In the test tube, synthetic RNA molecules have been shown to carry out other
biologically relevant reactions such as synthesis of ribonucleotides, synthesis
and copying of RNA molecules, and transfer of an RNA-bound amino acid to
a second amino acid forming a dipeptide, in a manner analogous to the role
of tRNA in protein synthesis. The discovery of these catalytic properties
solved the polynucleotide–polypeptide dilemma by showing that the first
biochemical systems could have been centered entirely on RNA.
Ideas about the RNA world have taken shape in recent years. We now envisage that RNA molecules initially replicated in a slow and haphazard fashion
simply by acting as templates for binding of complementary nucleotides
which polymerized spontaneously (Figure 18.2). This replication process
would have been very inaccurate so a variety of RNA sequences would have
been generated, eventually leading to one or more with nascent ribozyme
properties that were able to direct their own, more accurate self-replication.
It is possible that a form of natural selection operated so that the most efficient replicating systems began to predominate, as has been shown to occur
in experimental systems. A greater accuracy in replication would have
enabled RNAs to increase in length without losing their sequence specificity,
providing the potential for more sophisticated catalytic properties, possibly
culminating in structures as complex as present-day Group I introns (see
Figure 12.39) and ribosomal RNAs (see Figure 13.11).
To call the early RNAs “genomes” is a little fanciful, but the term protogenome
has attractions as a descriptor for molecules that were self-replicating and able
to direct simple biochemical reactions. These reactions might have included
energy metabolism based, as today, on the release of free energy by hydrolysis
of the phosphate–phosphate bonds in the ribonucleotides ATP and GTP, and
the reactions might have become compartmentalized within lipid membranes, forming the first cell-like structures. There are difficulties in envisaging how long-chain unbranched lipids could form by chemical- or ribozymecatalyzed reactions, but once present in sufficient quantities they would have
assembled spontaneously into membranes, possibly encapsulating one or
more protogenomes and providing the RNAs with an enclosed environment in
which more controlled biochemical reactions could be carried out.

The first DNA genomes
How did the RNA world develop into the DNA world? The first major change
was probably the development of protein enzymes, which supplemented,
and eventually replaced, most of the catalytic activities of ribozymes. There
are several unanswered questions relating to this stage of biochemical evolution, including the reason why the transition from RNA to protein occurred in
the first place. Originally, it was assumed that the 20 amino acids in polypeptides provided proteins with greater chemical variability than the four
ribonucleotides in RNA, enabling protein enzymes to catalyze a broader
range of biochemical reactions, but this explanation has become less attractive as more and more ribozyme-catalyzed reactions have been demonstrated in the test tube. A more recent suggestion is that protein-mediated
catalysis is more efficient because of the inherent flexibility of folded
polypeptides compared with the greater rigidity of base-paired RNAs.
Alternatively, enclosure of RNA protogenomes within membrane vesicles

could have prompted the evolution of the first proteins, because RNA molecules are hydrophilic and must be given a hydrophobic coat, for instance by
attachment to peptide molecules, before being able to pass through or
become integrated into a membrane.
The transition to protein-mediated catalysis demanded a radical shift in the
function of the RNA protogenomes. Rather than being directly responsible for
the biochemical reactions occurring in the early cell-like structures, the protogenomes became coding molecules whose main function was to specify
the construction of the catalytic proteins. Whether the ribozymes themselves
became coding molecules, or coding molecules were synthesized by the
ribozymes is not known, although the most persuasive theories about the origins of protein synthesis and the genetic code suggest that the latter alternative is more likely to be correct (Figure 18.3). Whatever the mechanism, the
result was the paradoxical situation whereby the RNA protogenomes had
abandoned their roles as enzymes, which they were good at, and taken on a
coding function for which they were less well suited because of the relative
instability of the RNA phosphodiester bond (Section 1.2.1). A transfer of the
coding function to the more stable DNA seems almost inevitable and would
not have been difficult to achieve, reduction of ribonucleotides giving
deoxyribonucleotides which could then be polymerized into copies of the
RNA protogenomes by a reverse-transcriptase-catalyzed reaction (Figure
18.4). The replacement of uracil with its methylated derivative thymine probably conferred even more stability on the DNA polynucleotide, and the adoption of double-stranded DNA as the coding molecule was almost certainly
prompted by the possibility of repairing DNA damage by copying the partner
strand (Sections 16.2.2 and 16.2.3).
According to this scenario, the first DNA genomes comprised many separate
molecules, each specifying a single protein and each therefore equivalent to
a single gene. The linking together of these genes into the first chromosomes,
which could have begun before the transition to DNA, would have improved
the efficiency of gene distribution during cell division, as it is easier to organize the equal distribution of a few large chromosomes than many separate
genes. As with most stages in early genome evolution, several different mechanisms by which genes might have become linked have been proposed.

Chapter 18 How Genomes Evolve

How unique is life?
If the experimental simulations and computer models are correct then it is
likely that the initial stages in biochemical evolution occurred many times in
parallel in the oceans or atmosphere of the early Earth. It is therefore quite
possible that “life” arose on more than one occasion, even though all presentday organisms appear to derive from a single origin. This single origin is indicated by the remarkable similarity between the basic molecular biological and
biochemical mechanisms in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cells. To take
just one example, there appears to be no obvious biological or chemical reason why any particular triplet of nucleotides should code for any particular
amino acid, but the genetic code, although not universal, is virtually the same
in all organisms that have been studied. If these organisms derived from more
than one origin then we would anticipate two or more very different codes.
If multiple origins are possible, but modern life is derived from just one origin, then at what stage did a single biochemical system begin to predominate? The question cannot be answered precisely, but the most likely scenario
is that the predominant system was the first to develop the means to synthesize protein enzymes and therefore probably also the first to adopt a DNA
genome. The greater catalytic potential and more accurate replication conferred by protein enzymes and DNA genomes would have given these cells a
significant advantage compared with those still containing RNA protogenomes. The DNA–RNA–protein cells would have multiplied more rapidly,
enabling them to out-compete the RNA cells for nutrients which, before long,
would have included the RNA cells themselves.
Are life forms based on informational molecules other than DNA and RNA
possible? It is not impossible that RNA was preceded by some other informational molecule at the very earliest period of biochemical evolution. In particular, a pyranosyl version of RNA, in which the sugar takes on a slightly different structure, might be a better choice than normal RNA for an early protogenome because the base-paired molecules that it forms are more stable.
The same is true of peptide nucleic acid (PNA), a polynucleotide analog in
which the sugar–phosphate backbone is replaced by amide bonds (Figure
18.5). PNAs have been synthesized in the test tube and have been shown to
form base pairs with normal polynucleotides. However, there are no indications that either pyranosyl RNA or PNA were more likely than RNA to have
evolved in the prebiotic soup.

Although the very old fossil record is difficult to interpret, there is reasonably
convincing evidence that by 3.5 billion years ago biochemical systems had
evolved into cells similar in appearance to modern bacteria. We cannot tell
from the fossils what kinds of genomes these first real cells had, but from the
discussion in the preceding section we can infer that they were made of double-stranded DNA and consisted of a small number of chromosomes, possibly just one, each containing many linked genes.
If we follow the fossil record forward in time we see the first evidence for
eukaryotic cells—structures resembling single-celled algae—about 1.4 billion years ago (Figure 18.6) and for multicellular algae about 0.9 billion years
ago. Multicellular animals appeared around 640 million years ago, although

there are enigmatic burrows suggesting that animals lived earlier than this.
The Cambrian Revolution, when invertebrate life proliferated into many
novel forms, occurred 530 million years ago and ended with the disappearance of many of the novel forms in a mass extinction 500 million years ago.
Since then, evolution has continued apace and with increasing diversification: the first terrestrial insects, animals, and plants were established by 350
million years ago, the dinosaurs had been and gone by the end of the
Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, and the first hominoids appeared a mere
4.5 million years ago.
Morphological evolution was accompanied by genome evolution. It is dangerous to equate evolution with “progress” but it is undeniable that as we
move up the evolutionary tree we see increasingly complex genomes. One
indication of this complexity is gene number, which varies from less than
1000 in some bacteria to 30,000–40,000 in vertebrates such as humans. Within
individual lineages—within the bacteria, for example—changes in gene
number have probably been gradual, with the acquisition of new genes balanced at least in part by the loss of existing ones. We should also remember
that the evolutionary pathways of some organisms have involved a decrease
rather than increase in gene number, leading to the minimal genomes of

Genomes Chapter 18

Chapter 18 How Genomes Evolve

Mycoplasma and other parasitic species (Section 8.2.2). The gradual changes
within lineages were, however, punctuated by at least two transition periods
when new organisms with greatly increased gene numbers appeared. One of
these transitions accompanied the arrival of the first eukaryotes about 1.4 billion years ago, these cells probably containing at least 10,000 genes (the minimum in modern eukaryotes) compared with the 5000 or fewer typical of
prokaryotes. The second transition was associated with the arrival of the first
vertebrates soon after the end of the Cambrian, these, like modern vertebrates, probably having at least 30,000 genes.
There are two fundamentally different ways in which new genes could be
acquired by a genome:
G

By duplicating some or all of the existing genes in the genome.

G

By acquiring genes from other species.

Both events have been important in genome evolution, as we will see in the
next two sections.

18.2.1 Acquisition of new genes by duplication events
A central role for gene duplication in genome evolution was first proposed in
1970. The initial result of gene duplication will be two identical genes.
Selective constraints will ensure that one of these genes retains its original
nucleotide sequence, or something very similar to it, so that it can continue
to provide the protein function that was originally supplied by the single gene
copy before the duplication took place. It is possible that the same selective
constraints will apply to the second gene, especially if the increase in the rate
of synthesis of the gene product, made possible by the duplication, confers a
benefit on the organism (Figure 18.7). More frequently, however, the second
copy will confer no benefit and hence will not be subject to the same selective pressures and so will accumulate mutations at random. Evidence shows
that the majority of new genes that arise by duplication acquire deleterious
mutations that inactivate them so that they become pseudogenes, examination of existing pseudogenes suggesting that the commonest inactivating
mutations are frameshifts and nonsense mutations that occur within the
coding region of the gene. Occasionally, however, mutations might not lead to
inactivation of the gene but instead result in a new gene function that is useful to the organism (see Figure 18.7).

We will first consider the evidence for past gene duplications that is contained in present-day genome sequences, and then look at the mechanisms
by which gene duplication can occur.

Genome sequences provide extensive evidence of past gene
duplications
The most cursory examination of a genome sequence provides ample evidence that many genes have arisen by duplication events. The importance of
the first scenario illustrated in Figure 18.7, where the increased amount of
gene product resulting from a gene duplication is beneficial and stabilizes the
duplication, is supported by the many examples of multigene families made
up of genes with identical or near-identical sequences. The prime examples
are the rRNA genes, whose copy numbers range from two in Mycoplasma genitalium to 500 or more in Xenopus laevis, with all of the copies having virtually the same sequence. These multiple copies of identical genes presumably
reflect the need for rapid synthesis of rRNAs at certain stages of the cell cycle.
Note that the existence of these multigene families indicates not only that
gene duplications have occurred in the past but also that there must be a
molecular mechanism that ensures that the family members retain their
identity over evolutionary time. This is called concerted evolution. If one
copy of the family acquires an advantageous mutation then it is possible for
that mutation to spread throughout the family until all members possess it.
The most likely way in which this can be achieved is by gene conversion
which, as described in Section 17.1.1, can result in the sequence of one copy
of a gene being replaced with all or part of the sequence of a second copy.
Multiple gene conversion events could therefore maintain identity among the
sequences of the individual members of a multigene family, especially if
those members are arranged in tandem arrays.

the superfamily are now on different

Chapter 18 How Genomes Evolve

The third scenario in Figure 18.7 results in the duplicated gene accumulating
mutations that give it a new, useful function. Again, multigene families provide many indications that such events have occurred frequently in the past.
We have already seen that gene duplications in the globin gene families led to
the evolution of new globin proteins that are used by the organism at different
stages in its development (see Figure 7.19). We noted that all the globin genes,
both the a- and b-types, have related nucleotide sequences and hence form
part of a superfamily that includes genes specifying various other proteins
which, like the blood globins, have the capacity to bind oxygen molecules.
From the degrees of similarity displayed by pairs of genes in the superfamily,
it is possible to deduce the pattern of gene duplications that gave rise to the
genes we see today, and by applying the molecular clock (Section 19.2.2) to
the data we can estimate how many millions of years ago each duplication
took place. These analyses tell us that a duplication some 800 million years
ago resulted in a pair of ancestral genes, one of which evolved into the modern gene for the brain protein neuroglobin, and the other of which gave rise to
all the other members of the superfamily (Figure 18.8). Some 250 million years
later there was a second duplication on the path leading to the blood globins,
one of the products of this duplication being a gene that, via another duplication, gave rise to myoglobin, which is active in muscle, and cytoglobin, which
is present in many tissues but whose function is not yet understood. The
proto-a and proto-b lineages split by a duplication that occurred 450 million
years ago and the duplications within the a- and b-globin gene families took

place during the last 200 million years. Within this more recent time frame it
is possible to deduce not only the pattern of gene duplication but also some
of the more detailed changes that have occurred within individual genes.
Hence the events leading to the various groups of b-globin genes present in
different mammals have been inferred (Figure 18.9).
We observe similar patterns of evolution when we compare the sequences of
other genes. The trypsin and chymotrypsin genes, for example, are related by
a common ancestral gene that duplicated approximately 1500 million years
ago. Both now code for proteases involved in protein breakdown in the vertebrate digestive tract, trypsin cutting other proteins at arginine and lysine
amino acids, and chymotrypsin cutting at phenylalanines, tryptophans, and
tyrosines. Genome evolution has therefore produced two complementary
protein functions where originally there was just one.
Another striking example of gene evolution by duplication is provided by the
homeotic selector genes, the key developmental genes responsible for specification of the body plans of animals. As described in Section 14.3.4,
Drosophila has a single cluster of homeotic selector genes, called HOM-C,
which consists of eight genes each containing a homeodomain sequence
coding for a DNA-binding motif in the protein product (see Figure 14.37).
These eight genes, as well as other homeodomain genes in Drosophila, are
believed to have arisen by a series of gene duplications that began with an
ancestral gene that existed about 1000 million years ago. The functions of the
modern genes, each specifying the identity of a different segment of the fruit
fly, gives us a tantalizing glimpse of how gene duplication and sequence
divergence could, in this case, have been the underlying processes responsible for increasing the morphological complexity of the series of organisms in
the Drosophila evolutionary tree. If we then move further up the evolutionary
tree we see that vertebrates have four Hox gene clusters (see Figure 14.37),
each a recognizable copy of the Drosophila cluster, with sequence similarities
between genes in equivalent positions. The implication is that in the vertebrate lineage there were two duplications, not of individual Hox genes but of
the entire cluster (Figure 18.10). Not all of the vertebrate Hox genes have been
ascribed functions, but we believe that the additional versions possessed by
vertebrates relate to the added complexity of the vertebrate body plan. Two
observations support this conclusion. The amphioxus, an invertebrate that
displays some primitive vertebrate features, has two Hox clusters, which is
what we might expect for a primitive “protovertebrate.” Ray-finned fishes,
probably the most diverse group of vertebrates with a vast range of different
variations of the basic body plan, have seven Hox clusters.

A variety of processes could result in gene duplication
There are several ways in which a short segment of a DNA molecule, possibly
containing one or a small group of genes, could be duplicated. These include:
G

Unequal crossing-over, which is a recombination event that is initiated
by similar nucleotide sequences that are not at identical places in a pair of
homologous chromosomes. As shown in Figure 18.11A, the result of
unequal crossing-over can be duplication of a segment of DNA in one of
the recombination products.

G

Unequal sister chromatid exchange, which occurs by the same mechanism as unequal crossing-over, but involves a pair of chromatids from a
single chromosome (Figure 18.11B).

In each case, recombination occurs
between two different copies of a short
repeat sequence, leading to duplication of
the sequence between the repeats.
Unequal crossing-over and unequal sister
chromatid exchange are essentially the
same except that the first involves
chromatids from a pair of homologous
chromosomes and the second involves
chromatids from a single chromosome. In
(C), recombination occurs between two
daughter double helices that have just been

G

DNA amplification, which is sometimes used in this context to describe
duplication of segments of DNA in bacteria and other haploid organisms,
the duplications arising by unequal recombination between the two
daughter DNA molecules in a replication bubble (Figure 18.11C).

G

Replication slippage (see Figure 16.5), which can result in duplication of
short segments such as microsatellite sequences. This process could conceivably duplicate a region large enough to contain an entire gene, but in
practice this is unlikely.

Each of the four processes listed above lead to tandem duplications—ones in
which the two duplicated segments lie adjacent to one another in the
genome. This is the pattern seen with many multigene families, such as the
a-globin gene family on human chromosome 16 and the b-globin family on
chromosome 11, but it is not the only possibility. Family members are not
always colocated: for example, in the human genome there are three functional genes for the metabolic enzyme aldolase, each on a different chromosome. These copies might have once been present as a tandem array, and
become dispersed as part of large-scale genome reorganizations, but it is also
possible that the distant locations are a consequence of the duplication
process. This would be the case if the duplication occurred by retrotransposition in a manner similar to that thought to lead to formation of processed
pseudogenes (see Figure 7.20). A processed pseudogene arises when the
mRNA copy of a gene is converted into cDNA and reinserted into the
genome. The resulting structure is a pseudogene because it lacks a promoter
sequence, this being absent from the mRNA. The pseudogene could conceivably be inserted adjacent to the promoter of an existing gene and hence
become active by subverting this promoter for its own use. Gene duplicates
that arise in this way are called retrogenes and, again, many examples are
known in different genomes (in the human genome the testis-specific version of the pyruvate dehydrogenase gene is a retrogene). A distinctive feature
of a retrogene is that it lacks any introns present in the parent copy of the
gene, as these are not present in the mRNA. Recently it has been realized that
complete copies of genes, including not only the introns but also some or all
of the promoter sequences, can also be made by reverse transcription. This
can occur when the RNA that is reverse-transcribed is not an mRNA, but an
antisense copy of the gene made by transcription of the “wrong” polynucleotide (Figure 18.12). We are beginning to realize that antisense RNAs are
not uncommon and may indeed have a role in gene regulation, similar perhaps to the mode of action of microRNAs (Section 12.2.6). If converted into
cDNA, then an antisense RNA could provide a full-length, functional gene
duplicate for insertion into the genome, at a position that could be distant
from the original copy.

Whole genome duplication is also possible
The processes described above give rise to relatively short DNA duplications,
perhaps a few tens of kilobases in length. Are larger duplications possible? It
seems unlikely that duplication of entire chromosomes has played any major
role in genome evolution, because we know that duplication of individual
human chromosomes, resulting in a cell that contains three copies of one
chromosome and two copies of all the others (the condition called trisomy),
is either lethal or results in a genetic disease, such as Down syndrome, and
similar harmful effects have been observed in artificially generated trisomic
mutants of Drosophila. Probably, the resulting increase in copy numbers for

some genes but not others leads to an imbalance of the gene products and
disruption of the cellular biochemistry.
The harmful effects of trisomy do not mean that duplication of the entire set
of chromosomes in a nucleus must be discounted. Genome duplication can
occur if an error during meiosis leads to the production of gametes that are
diploid rather than haploid (Figure 18.13). If two diploid gametes fuse then
the result will be a type of autopolyploid, in this case a tetraploid cell whose
nucleus contains four copies of each chromosome. Autopolyploidy, as with
other types of polyploidy (Section 18.2.2), is not uncommon, especially
among plants. Autopolyploids are often viable because each chromosome
still has a homologous partner and so can form a bivalent during meiosis.
This allows an autopolyploid to reproduce successfully, but generally prevents interbreeding with the original organism from which it was derived.
This is because a cross between, for example, a tetraploid and diploid would

Fusion of a diploid gamete produced by the
aberrant meiosis shown in Figure 18.13
with a haploid gamete produced by normal
meiosis leads to a triploid nucleus, one that
has three copies of each homologous
chromosome. During prophase I of the next
meiosis, two of these homologous
chromosomes will form a bivalent but the
third will have no partner. This has a
disruptive effect on the segregation of
chromosomes during anaphase (see Figure
3.16) and usually prevents meiosis from
reaching a successful conclusion. This
means that gametes are not produced and
the triploid organism is sterile. Note that the

give a triploid offspring which would not itself be able to reproduce because
one full set of its chromosomes would lack homologous partners (Figure
18.14). Autopolyploidy is therefore a mechanism by which speciation can
occur, a pair of species usually being defined as two organisms that are
unable to interbreed. The generation of new plant species by autopolyploidy
has in fact been observed, notably by Hugo de Vries, one of the rediscoverers
of Mendel’s experiments. During his work with evening primrose, Oenothera
lamarckiana, de Vries isolated a tetraploid version of this normally diploid
plant, which he named Oenothera gigas. Autopolyploidy among animals is
less common, especially in those with two distinct sexes, possibly because of
problems that arise if a nucleus possesses more than one pair of sex chromosomes. It is not impossible though, and at least one mammal, the red viscacha rat of Argentina, has a tetraploid genome.

Analysis of modern genomes provides evidence for past genome
duplications
Autopolyploidy does not lead directly to an increase in gene number because
the initial product is an organism that simply has extra copies of every gene,
rather than any new genes. It does, however, provide the potential for an
increase because the extra genes are not essential to the functioning of the
cell and so can undergo mutational change without harming the viability of
the organism. With this in mind, is there any evidence that whole genome
duplication has been important in the large-scale acquisition of new genes
during the evolutionary histories of present-day genomes?
From what we understand about the way in which genomes change over
time, we might anticipate that evidence for whole genome duplication would
be quite difficult to obtain. Many of the extra gene copies resulting from
genome duplication would decay to the extent that they are no longer visible
in the DNA sequence. Those genes that are retained, because their duplicated
function is useful to the organism or because they have evolved new functions, should be identifiable, but it would be difficult to distinguish if they
have arisen by duplication of the entire genome or by duplication of much
smaller segments. For a genome duplication to be signaled it would be necessary to find large, duplicated sets of genes, with the same order of genes in
both sets. To what extent these duplicated sets are still visible in the genome
will depend on how frequently past recombination events have moved genes
to new positions.
To search the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome for evidence of past duplications, homology analysis (Section 5.2.1) was carried out with every yeast gene
tested against every other yeast gene. To be considered descendants of a
duplication event, two genes had to display at least 25% identity when the predicted amino acid sequences of their protein products were compared. About
800 gene pairs were identified in this way, 376 of which could be placed in 55
duplicate sets, each of these sets containing at least three genes in the same
order (Figure 18.15), possibly with other genes interspersed between them,
the sets altogether covering half the genome. These sets could have arisen by
duplication of segments rather than the entire genome, but if this was the case
then it might be anticipated that some of the genes would have been duplicated more than once. The fact that there were just two copies of each gene,
and never three or four, therefore supported the notion that the copies arose
by whole genome duplication. This possibility became more certain when the

Genomes Chapter 18

complete genome sequences of other yeast species were obtained.
Comparisons between the genomes of S. cerevisiae, Kluyveromyces lactis, and
Ashbya gossypii have been particularly informative. These three species
shared a common ancestor that lived over 100 million years ago, previous to
the time of the genome duplication event inferred from the homology analysis. If that duplication had indeed occurred in the lineage leading to S. cerevisiae then it would be anticipated that this species would have duplicated
copies of many genes present as singletons in the K. lactis and A. gossypii
genomes. This turns out to be the case, this new analysis suggesting that some
10% of the genes in the modern S. cerevisiae genome derive from a whole
genome duplication that occurred just under 100 million years ago.
Equivalent work has been carried out with other genomes and the picture
that is emerging is that whole genome duplication has been a relatively frequent event in the evolution of many groups of organisms. For example, comparisons between the Arabidopsis thaliana genome sequence and segments
of other plant genomes suggest that the ancestor of the A. thaliana genome
underwent four rounds of genome duplication between 100 million and 200
million years ago. The human genome and other mammalian genomes also
contain so many gene duplicates that at least one whole genome duplication
event is thought to have occurred in this lineage between 350 million and 600
million years ago.

Smaller duplications can also be identified in the human genome
and other genomes

This and other duplicated sets provide
evidence for a genome duplication just
under 100 million years ago in the S.
cerevisiae lineage.

Although the most recent whole genome duplication in the human lineage
occurred a considerable time ago, the human genome has not been quiescent in the intervening period. Indeed, the opposite is true, one surprise provided by the human genome sequence being the realization that there has
been extensive and frequent duplication of short segments of the genome
in the relatively recent past. This is illustrated by Figure 18.16, which depicts
the duplication events that are inferred for the last 35 million years of evolution of the long arm of human chromosome 22. As in the yeast study
described above, these duplications have been identified by comparing different parts of the genome, in this case to identify regions of more than 1 kb
in length that display 90% or higher nucleotide sequence similarity. This
analysis ignores interspersed repeat sequences and so locates regions that

are probably the products of relatively recent duplication events. Almost 200
segments, making up over 10% of this 34 Mb region of the human genome,
appear to have arisen by duplications that occurred within the last 35 million
years. Over 100 of these segments are duplicates of sequences present on
other chromosomes, and the remainder are duplicates with both copies
located within this arm.
The pattern of duplications in the long arm of chromosome 22 is fairly typical of the human genome as a whole. Individual duplications range from 1 to
400 kb in length and there is a distinct bias toward the areas adjacent to the
centromeres, with relatively few duplications in the more distal regions of
each chromosome arm. When considering the size of these segment duplications, we must bear in mind that the average human gene is 20–25 kb in
length and that the genes are scattered sparsely throughout the genome.
When the sequences of the segment duplications are examined it emerges
that few of these duplication events result in duplication of entire genes, but
that several involve parts of genes, and that some of these duplications lead
to the upstream exons of one gene being placed alongside downstream
exons of a second gene. Some of these new combinations are transcribed,
but it is not clear whether the transcripts are functional. The evolutionary
potential of segment duplications is therefore uncertain. What is clear, however, is that recombination between a pair of intrachromosomal duplications can result in deletion of the region between the duplications, and that
deletions generated in this way can give rise to genetic disease. An example
is Charcot–Marie–Tooth syndrome, which develops 5–15 years after birth and
is characterized by degeneration of the peripheral nervous system, leading to
weakness and difficulty in walking. The syndrome is caused by recombination between a pair of 24 kb segment duplications on human chromosome
17, deleting a 1.5 Mb segment of the genome. The loss of the genes contained
in this segment gives rise to the disease.

Genome evolution also involves rearrangement of existing genes
The range of sizes observed for segment duplications in the human genome
raises the possibility that the duplication events illustrated in Figure 18.11
could, as well as giving rise to new copies of genes, cause alterations within
existing genes. This would be an alternative way in which novel protein functions could evolve. This is possible because most proteins are made up of
structural domains, each comprising a segment of the polypeptide chain
and hence encoded by a contiguous series of nucleotides (Figure 18.17).
Rearrangement of domain-encoding gene segments could result in novel
protein functions:
G

Figure 18.17 Each structural domain is
an individual unit in a polypeptide chain
and is coded by a contiguous series of
nucleotides. In this simplified example,
each secondary structure in the polypeptide
is looked upon as an individual structural
domain. In reality, most structural domains
comprise two or more secondary structural
units.

Domain duplication would occur when the gene segment coding for a
structural domain is duplicated by unequal crossing-over, replication
slippage, or one of the other methods that we have considered for duplication of DNA sequences (Figure 18.18A). Duplication could result in the
structural domain being repeated in the protein, which might itself be

advantageous, for example by making the protein more stable. The duplicated domain might also change over time as its coding sequence
becomes mutated, leading to a modified structure that might provide the
protein with a new activity. Note that domain duplication causes the gene
to become longer. Gene elongation appears to be a general consequence
of genome evolution, the genes of higher eukaryotes being longer, on
average, than those of lower organisms.
G

Domain shuffling would occur when segments coding for structural
domains from completely different genes are joined together to form a
new coding sequence that specifies a hybrid or mosaic protein, one that
would have a novel combination of structural features and might provide
the cell with an entirely new biochemical function (Figure 18.18B).

Implicit in these models of domain duplication and shuffling is the need for
the relevant gene segments to be separated so that they can themselves be
rearranged and shuffled. This requirement has led to the attractive suggestion
that exons might code for structural domains. With some proteins, duplication
or shuffling of exons does seem to have resulted in the structures seen today.
An example is provided by the a2 Type I collagen gene of vertebrates, which
codes for one of the three polypeptide chains of collagen. Each of the three
collagen polypeptides has a highly repetitive sequence made up of repeats of
the tripeptide glycine–X–Y, where X is usually proline and Y is usually hydroxyproline (Figure 18.19). The chicken a2 Type I gene is split into 52 exons, 42 of
which cover the part of the gene coding for the glycine–X–Y repeats. Within

Figure 18.19 The a2 Type I collagen
polypeptide has a repetitive sequence
described as Gly–X–Y. Every third amino
acid is glycine, X is often proline, and Y is
often hydroxyproline (Hyp). Hydroxyproline
is synthesized by posttranslational
modification of proline (Section 13.3.3).
The collagen polypeptide has a helical
conformation, but one that is more
extended than the standard a-helix.

this region, each exon encodes a set of complete tripeptide repeats. The number of repeats per exon varies but is 5 (in 5 exons), 6 (23 exons), 11 (5 exons),
12 (8 exons), or 18 (1 exon). Clearly this gene could have evolved by duplication of exons leading to repetition of the structural domains.
Domain shuffling is illustrated by tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), a protein found in the blood of vertebrates and which is involved in the blood clotting response. The TPA gene has four exons, each coding for a different structural domain (Figure 18.20). The upstream exon codes for a “finger” module
that enables the TPA protein to bind to fibrin, a fibrous protein found in
blood clots and which activates TPA. This exon appears to be derived from a
second fibrin-binding protein, fibronectin, and is absent from the gene for a
related protein, urokinase, which is not activated by fibrin. The second TPA
exon specifies a growth factor domain which has apparently been obtained
from the gene for epidermal growth factor and which may enable TPA to
stimulate cell proliferation. The last two exons code for “kringle” structures
which TPA uses to bind to fibrin clots; these kringle exons come from the
plasminogen gene.
Type I collagen and TPA provide elegant examples of gene evolution but,
unfortunately, the clear links that they display between structural domains
and exons are exceptional and are rarely seen with other genes. Many other
genes appear to have evolved by duplication and shuffling of segments, but
in these the structural domains are coded by segments of genes that do not
coincide with individual exons or even groups of exons. Domain duplication
and shuffling still occur, but presumably in a less precise manner and with
many of the rearranged genes having no useful function. Despite being haphazard, the process clearly works, as indicated by, among other examples, the
number of proteins that share the same DNA-binding motifs (Section 11.1.1).
Several of these motifs probably evolved de novo on more than one occasion,
but it is clear that in many cases the nucleotide sequence coding for the motif
has been transferred to a variety of different genes.
One possible mechanism for moving gene segments around a genome is in
association with transposable elements. The transposition of a LINE-1 element
(Section 9.2.1) can occasionally result in a short piece of the adjacent DNA

being transferred along with the transposon, a process called 3¢¢ transduction,
the transferred segment being located at the 3¢ end of the element. LINE-1 elements are sometimes found in introns so 3¢ transduction could conceivably
move downstream exons to new sites in a genome. Movement of exons and
other gene segments might also be brought about by DNA transposons called
Mutator-like transposable elements (MULEs), which are found in many
eukaryotes but are especially common in plants. MULEs often contain within
their DNA sequence segments of genes captured from the host genome (Figure
18.21). Transposition of a MULE would therefore move the captured segments
to a new location. MULEs can collect segments of different genes as they travel
around a genome, assembling new hybrid genes as they go. MULEs therefore
provide an attractive way of driving gene evolution, but there are still several
unanswered questions about their impact. In particular, it is not yet clear how
frequently gene segments are able to escape from MULEs.

18.2.2 Acquisition of new genes from other species
The second possible way in which a genome can acquire new genes is to
obtain them from another species. Comparisons of bacterial and archaeal
genome sequences suggest that lateral gene transfer has been a major event
in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes (Section 8.2.3). The genomes of most
bacteria and archaea contain at least a few hundred kilobases of DNA, representing tens of genes, that appears to have been acquired from a second
prokaryote.
There are several mechanisms by which genes can be transferred between
prokaryotes but it is difficult to be sure how important these various
processes have been in shaping the genomes of these organisms.
Conjugation (Section 3.2.4), for example, enables plasmids to move between
bacteria and frequently results in the acquisition of new gene functions by the
recipients. On a day-to-day basis, plasmid transfer is important because it is
the means by which genes for resistance to antibiotics such as chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and streptomycin spread through bacterial populations and
across species barriers, but its evolutionary relevance is questionable. It is
true that the genes transferred by conjugation can become integrated into the
recipient bacterium’s genome, but usually the genes are carried by composite
transposons (see Figure 9.17B), which means that the integration is reversible
and so might not result in a permanent change to the genome. A second
process for DNA transfer between prokaryotes, transformation (Section
3.2.4), is more likely to have had an influence on genome evolution. Only a
few bacteria, notably members of the Bacillus, Pseudomonas, and
Streptococcus genera, have efficient mechanisms for the uptake of DNA from
the surrounding environment, but efficiency of DNA uptake is probably not
relevant when we are dealing with an evolutionary timescale. More important
is the fact that gene flow by transformation can occur between any pair of
prokaryotes, not just closely related ones (as is the case with conjugation),

and so could account for the transfers that appear to have occurred between
bacterial and archaeal genomes (Section 8.2.3).
In plants, new genes can be acquired by polyploidization. We have already
seen how autopolyploidization can result in genome duplication in plants
(see Figure 18.13). Allopolyploidy, which results from interbreeding between
two different species, is also common and, like autopolyploidy, can result in a
viable hybrid. Usually, the two species that form the allopolyploid are closely
related and have many genes in common, but each parent will possess a few
novel genes or at least distinctive alleles of shared genes. For example, the
bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid that arose by allopolyploidization between cultivated emmer wheat, T. turgidum, which is a tetraploid, and
a diploid wild grass, Aegilops squarrosa. The wild grass nucleus contained
novel alleles for the high-molecular-weight glutenin genes which, when combined with the glutenin alleles already present in emmer wheat, resulted in
the superior properties for breadmaking displayed by the hexaploid wheats.
Allopolyploidization can therefore be looked upon as a combination of
genome duplication and interspecies gene transfer.
Among animals, the species barriers are less easy to cross and it is difficult to
find clear evidence for lateral gene transfer of any kind. Several eukaryotic
genes have features associated with archaeal or bacterial sequences, but
rather than being the result of lateral gene transfer, these similarities are
thought to result from conservation during millions of years of parallel evolution. Most proposals for gene transfer between animal species center on
retroviruses and transposable elements. Transfer of retroviruses between animal species is well documented, as is their ability to carry animal genes
between individuals of the same species, suggesting that they might be possible mediators of lateral gene transfer. The same could be true of transposable
elements such as P elements, which are known to spread from one Drosophila
species to another, and mariner, which has also been shown to transfer
between Drosophila species and which may have crossed from other species
into humans.

18.3 Noncoding DNA and Genome Evolution
So far we have concentrated our attention on the evolution of the coding component of the genome. As coding DNA makes up only 1.5% of the human
genome, our view of genome evolution would be very incomplete if we did not
devote some time to considering noncoding DNA. The presence of extensive
amounts of noncoding DNA in eukaryotic genomes is a puzzle for molecular
evolutionists. Why is this apparently superfluous DNA tolerated? One possibility is that the noncoding DNA has a function that has not yet been identified
and, as such, must be maintained because without it the cell would be nonviable. Plausible functions are not as difficult to identify as might be imagined.
In several places in the preceding chapters the importance of chromatin structure has been stressed, including the attachment of chromatin to sites within
the nucleus. Possibly, some of the noncoding component of a genome is
involved in these aspects of genome organization. Alternatively, noncoding
DNA might have a broad-ranging control function that so far has eluded discovery by molecular biologists. A final possibility is that noncoding DNA has
no function but is tolerated by a genome because there is no selective pressure

to get rid of it. If this view is correct then possession of noncoding DNA is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage and so the noncoding DNA is simply
propagated along with the coding DNA. According to this hypothesis, the noncoding DNA could simply be “junk” or might be parasitic “selfish DNA.”
There is little that can be said about the evolution of much of the noncoding
component of a genome. We envisage that duplications and other rearrangements have occurred through recombination and replication slippage, and
that sequences have diverged through accumulation of mutations unfettered by the restraining selective forces acting on functional regions of the
genome. We recognize that some parts of the noncoding DNA, for example
the regulatory regions upstream of genes, have important functions, but for
many other parts of the noncoding DNA, all we can say is that it evolves in an
apparently random fashion. But this randomness does not apply to all components of the noncoding DNA. In particular, transposable elements and
introns have interesting evolutionary histories and are of general importance
in genome evolution.

18.3.1 Transposable elements and genome evolution
Transposable elements have a number of effects on evolution of the genome
as a whole. The most significant of these is the ability of transposons to initiate recombination events that lead to genome rearrangements. This has
nothing to do with the transposable activity of these elements, it simply
relates to the fact that different copies of the same element have similar
sequences and can therefore initiate recombination between two parts of the
same chromosome or between different chromosomes (Figure 18.22). In
many cases, the resulting rearrangement will be harmful because important
genes will be deleted, but some instances where the result has been beneficial have been documented. Recombination between a pair of LINE-1 elements (Section 9.2.1) approximately 35 million years ago is thought to be the
cause of the b-globin gene duplication that resulted in the Gg and Ag members of this gene family (see Figure 18.9).
Movement of transposons from one site to another can also have an impact
on genome evolution. The possible relocation of gene segments during transposition of LINE elements and MULEs was mentioned in Section 18.2.1.
Transposition has also been associated with altered patterns of gene expression. For example, the efficiency with which DNA-binding proteins that are
attached to upstream regulatory sequences can activate transcription of a
gene might be affected if a transposon moves into a new site immediately
upstream of the gene (Figure 18.23). The presence of promoters and/or
enhancers within the transposon might also affect transcription by subjecting the adjacent gene to an entirely new regulatory regime. An interesting
example of transposon-directed gene expression occurs with the mouse gene
Slp, which codes for a protein involved in the immune response. The tissue
specificity of Slp is conferred by an enhancer located within an adjacent
retrotransposon. There are also examples where insertion of a transposon
into a gene has resulted in an altered splicing pattern.

18.3.2 The origins of introns
Ever since introns were first discovered in the 1970s their origins have been
debated. There are few controversies surrounding the Group I, II, and III
types (see Table 12.2) as it is generally accepted that all these self-splicing

introns evolved in the RNA world and have survived ever since without
undergoing a great deal of change. The problems surround the origin of the
GU–AG introns, the ones that are found in large numbers in eukaryotic
nuclear genomes.

“Introns early” and “introns late”: two competing hypotheses
A number of proposals for the origin of GU–AG introns have been put forward
but the debate is generally considered to be between two opposing hypotheses:

Short genes

Early genome

G

“Introns early” states that introns are very ancient and are gradually
being lost from eukaryotic genomes.

G

“Introns late” states that introns evolved relatively recently and are gradually accumulating in eukaryotic genomes.

Single discontinuous gene

There are several different models for each hypothesis. For “introns early” the
most persuasive model is the one also called the “exon theory of genes,” which
holds that introns were formed when the first DNA genomes were constructed, soon after the end of the RNA world. These genomes would have
contained many short genes, each derived from a single coding RNA molecule
and each specifying a very small polypeptide, perhaps just a single structural
domain. These polypeptides would probably have had to associate together
into larger multidomain proteins in order to produce enzymes with specific
and efficient catalytic mechanisms (Figure 18.24). To aid the synthesis of a
multidomain enzyme it would have been beneficial for the enzyme’s individual polypeptides to become linked into a single protein, such as we see today.
It is envisaged that this was achieved by splicing together the transcripts of the
relevant minigenes, a process that was aided by rearranging the genome so
that groups of minigenes specifying the different parts of individual multidomain proteins were positioned next to each other. In other words, the minigenes became exons and the DNA sequences between them became introns.

Figure 18.24 The “exon theory of genes.”
The short genes of the first genomes
probably coded for single-domain
polypeptides that would have had to
associate together to form a multisubunit
protein to produce an effective enzyme.
Later the synthesis of this enzyme could
have been made more efficient by linking
the short genes together into one
discontinuous gene coding for a
multidomain single-subunit protein.

According to the exon theory of genes and other “introns early” hypotheses,
all genomes originally possessed introns. But we know that bacterial
genomes do not have GU–AG introns, so if these hypotheses are correct then
we must assume that for some reason introns became lost from the ancestral
bacterial genome at an early stage in its evolution. This is a stumbling block
because it is difficult to envisage how a large number of introns could be lost
from a genome without risking the disruption of many gene functions. If an
intron is removed from a gene with any imprecision then a part of the coding
region will be lost or a frameshift mutation will occur, both of which would be
expected to inactivate the gene. The “introns late” hypothesis avoids this

problem by proposing that, to begin with, no genes had introns, these structures invading the early eukaryotic nuclear genome and subsequently proliferating into the numbers seen today. The similarities between the splicing
pathways for GU–AG and Group II introns (Section 12.2.4) suggest that the
invaders that gave rise to GU–AG introns might well have been Group II
sequences that escaped from organelle genomes. However, the similarity
between GU–AG and Group II introns does not prove the “introns late” view,
because it is equally possible to devise an “introns early” model, different to
the exon theory of genes, in which Group II sequences gave rise to GU–AG
introns, but at a very early stage in genome evolution.

The current evidence disproves neither hypothesis
One of the reasons why the debate regarding the origin of GU–AG introns has
continued for over 25 years is because evidence in support of either hypothesis has been difficult to obtain and is often ambiguous. One prediction of
“introns early” is that there should be a close similarity between the positions
of introns in homologous genes from unrelated organisms, because all these
genes are descended from an ancestral intron-containing gene (Figure 18.25).
Early support for “introns early” came when this was shown to be the case for
four introns in animal and plant genes for triosephosphate isomerase.
However, when a larger number of species was examined, the positions of the
introns in this gene became less easy to interpret: it appeared that introns had
been lost in some lineages but gained in others. This scenario fits both “introns
early” and “introns late,” as both hypotheses allow for the loss, gain, or repositioning of introns by recombination events occurring in individual lineages.
When many genes in many organisms are examined, the general picture that
emerges is that intron numbers have gradually increased during the evolution
of animal genomes, this being put forward as evidence for “introns late,”
despite the fact that animal mitochondrial genomes do not contain Group II
introns that could supplement the existing nuclear introns by repeated invasions. Intron numbers must therefore have increased by recombination events.
An alternative approach has been to try to correlate exons with protein structural domains, as the “introns early” hypothesis predicts that such a link
should be evident, even allowing for the fuzzying effects of evolution since
the primitive minigenes were assembled into the first real genes. Again, the
first evidence to be obtained supported “introns early.” A study of vertebrate
globin proteins concluded that each of these comprises four structural
domains, the first corresponding to exon 1 of the globin gene, the second and
third to exon 2, and the fourth to exon 3 (Figure 18.26). The prediction that
there should be globin genes with another intron that splits the second and

585

Figure 18.25 One prediction of the
“introns early” hypothesis is that the
positions of introns in homologous genes
should be similar in unrelated organisms,
because all these genes are descended

third domains was found to be correct when the leghemoglobin gene of soybean was shown to have an intron at exactly the expected position.
Unfortunately, as more globin genes were sequenced, more introns were discovered—more than ten in all. The positions of the majority of these do not
correspond to junctions between domains.
The globin genes therefore conform with the general principle that emerged
from our discussion of domain shuffling (Section 18.2.1): that in most cases
there are no clear links between gene exons and protein structural domains.
But is our definition of “structural domain” correct? A structural domain
within a protein may not simply correspond with a group of secondary structures such as a-helices and b-sheets. A more subtle interpretation might be
that a structural domain is a polypeptide segment whose amino acids are less
than a certain distance apart in the protein’s tertiary structure. It has been
suggested that when this definition is adopted there is a better correlation
between structural domain and exons.

18.4 The Human Genome: the Last Five
Million Years
Although the evolutionary history of humans is controversial, it is generally
accepted that our closest relative among the primates is the chimpanzee and
that the most recent ancestor that we share with the chimpanzee lived 4.6–5.0
million years ago. Since the split, the human lineage has embraced two genera—Australopithecus and Homo—and a number of species, not all of which
were on the direct line of descent to Homo sapiens (Figure 18.27). The result
is us, a novel species in possession of what are, at least to our eyes, important
biological attributes that make us very different from all other animals. So
how different are we from the chimpanzees?
As far as our genomes are concerned the answer is 1.73%, this being the
extent of the nucleotide sequence dissimilarity between humans and chimpanzees. Indeed, when the human and chimpanzee genomes are compared
it is much easier to find similarities than differences. The degree of nucleotide
sequence identity within the coding DNA is greater than 98.5%, with 29% of

the genes in the human genome coding for proteins whose amino acid
sequences are identical to the sequences of their counterparts in chimpanzees. Even in the noncoding regions of the human and chimpanzee
genomes the nucleotide identity is rarely less than 97%. Gene order is almost
the same in the two genomes, and the chromosomes have very similar
appearances. At this level, the most dramatic difference is that human chromosome 2 is two separate chromosomes in chimpanzees (Figure 18.28), so
chimpanzees, as well as other apes, have 24 pairs of chromosomes whereas
humans have just 23 pairs. The alphoid DNA sequences present at human
centromeres (Section 7.1.2) are quite different from the equivalent sequences
in chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes, and Alu elements (Section 9.2.1)
are more prevalent in the human genome, but these features probably tell us
more about the evolution of repetitive DNA than about the differences
between humans and chimpanzees.
Comparisons of the human and chimpanzee genomes have also failed to
reveal changes to individual genes which might somehow be key to the special attributes of humans. Analyses designed to reveal genes that have been
under positive selection in the human lineage have identified several associated with amino acid breakdown, in line with the greater proportion of meat
eaten by humans compared with chimpanzees. Genes providing protection
against human diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria have also been subject to positive selection. But no genes with clear roles in brain or neuronal
development have been uncovered by this type of analysis. The only substantial difference in gene structure is that humans lack a 92 bp segment of the
gene for N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid hydroxylase and so cannot synthesize
the hydroxylated form of N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid, which is present on the
surfaces of some chimpanzee cells. This may have an effect on the ability of
certain pathogens to enter human cells, and could possibly influence some
types of cell–cell interaction, but the difference is not thought to be particularly significant. Two other genes that are functional in chimpanzees appear
to have been inactivated by point mutations in the human genome, one of
these coding for a T-cell receptor and the other for a hair keratin protein, but
neither of these changes is likely to have had any substantial impact on
human evolution. In any case, it seems impossible that the special features of
humans could have arisen as a result of a gene knockout. Instead we need to
find genes whose activities have changed rather than been lost. In this regard,
considerable interest has centered on the gene for the FOXP2 transcription
factor, as defects in this protein result in the human disability called
dysarthria, characterized by a difficulty in articulating speech. This gene
might therefore underlie the human ability for language. There are indeed
two amino acid differences between the FOXP2 genes in humans and chimpanzees, suggesting that this gene has undergone relatively recent change,
but a direct link between these amino acid differences and human linguistic
ability is elusive.

Chapter 18 How Genomes Evolve

It is now becoming clear that many, if not all, of the key differences between
humans and chimpanzees are likely to lie not with the genomes themselves
but with the way the genomes are expressed. Attention is therefore moving
from the genomes to the transcriptomes and proteomes, and these studies
are beginning to suggest that the pattern of genome expression in the brain
has undergone significant change in the human lineage since the divergence
of humans and chimpanzees. Of course, this is precisely what we might
expect, as it is clearly our brains that distinguish us from chimpanzees and
other animals. The key question, which has not yet been answered, is whether
the identities of the genes that are up- or downregulated in the human brain
are informative in any way.

Summary
It is thought that the first polynucleotides to evolve, several billion years ago,
were made of RNA rather than DNA. These RNA molecules probably combined a self-replicating ability with some enzymatic activity, and it is possible
that enclosure of these in simple, lipid envelopes gave rise to the progenitors
of the first cells. Experiments have suggested that short peptides might be
constructed by catalytic RNAs, these peptides taking over some of the enzymatic functions of the ribozymes. DNA probably evolved as a more stable version of the RNA protogenomes. During evolution, there have been at least
two periods when more complex genomes have emerged, in each case ones
with increased gene numbers. Gene duplication is known to be an important
event that can result in a genome acquiring new genes. The globin gene
superfamily arose by a series of gene duplications whose pattern and timing
can be inferred by making comparisons between the sequences of the globin
genes in existence today. Duplication events have also played an important
role during evolution of the homeotic selector genes that specify the body
plan of eukaryotes. Duplication of entire genomes is also possible and is
thought to have occurred in the lineages leading to Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
to Arabidopsis thaliana, and also to vertebrates. Smaller duplications, of a few
tens of kilobases, have occurred regularly in the recent evolution of the
human genome. Some of these have resulted in new combinations of exons,
and some genes have clearly arisen by duplication or shuffling of protein
domains coded by individual exons. Exons can also be transported around a
genome by attachment to transposable elements. Lateral gene transfer
results in the acquisition of genes from other species. This has been a regular
event in the evolution of prokaryotic genomes but is much less common in
eukaryotes, except possibly in plants which can form new polyploids by
fusion of gametes from related species. The origin of introns is unclear, with
evidence supporting both the “introns early” and “introns late” hypotheses.
The former suggests that the first genomes had introns which are gradually
being lost, and the latter proposes there has been a gradual increase in intron
numbers. Five million years ago the human and chimpanzee lineages
diverged. The genomes of humans and chimpanzees still display 98.3%
nucleotide sequence identity, with many genes giving rise to identical protein
products. Identifying specific features of the human genome that make us
human is proving difficult, and it is now thought that the most important differences between humans and chimpanzees might not be the genomes
themselves but the way in which the genomes are expressed.

19.1 From Classification to Molecular
Phylogenetics
19.2 The Reconstruction of DNA-based
Phylogenetic Trees

When you have read Chapter 19, you should be able to:
Recount how taxonomy led to phylogeny and discuss the reasons why molecular markers are
important in phylogenetics.
Describe the key features of a phylogenetic tree and distinguish between inferred trees, true trees,
gene trees, and species trees.
Explain how data from which a tree can be reconstructed are obtained from a multiple alignment
of DNA sequences.
Outline the basis to the neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods for tree reconstruction.
Describe how the accuracy of a tree is assessed.
Discuss, with examples, the applications and limitations of molecular clocks.
Explain why the evolutionary relationships of some DNA sequences cannot be described by a
conventional tree, and describe how networks are used to overcome these problems.
Give examples of the use of phylogenetic trees in studies of human evolution and the evolution of
the human and simian immunodeficiency viruses.
Outline how genes are studied in populations.
Describe how molecular phylogenetics is being used to study the origins of modern humans, and
the migrations of modern humans into Europe and the New World.

If genomes evolve by the gradual accumulation of mutations, then the
amount of difference in nucleotide sequence between a pair of genomes
should indicate how recently those two genomes shared a common ancestor.
Two genomes that diverged in the recent past would be expected to have
fewer differences than a pair of genomes whose common ancestor is more
ancient. This means that by comparing three or more genomes it should be
possible to work out the evolutionary relationships between them. These are
the objectives of molecular phylogenetics.

Ancestor

Figure 19.1 The tree of life. An ancestral
species is at the bottom of the “trunk” of
the tree. As time passes, new species
evolve from earlier ones so the tree
repeatedly branches until we reach the
present time, when there are many species
descended from the ancestor.

19.1 From Classification to Molecular
Phylogenetics
Molecular phylogenetics predates DNA sequencing by several decades. It is
derived from the traditional method for classifying organisms according to
their similarities and differences, as first practiced in a comprehensive fashion by Linnaeus in the eighteenth century. Linnaeus was a systematicist not
an evolutionist, his objective being to place all known organisms into a logical classification which he believed would reveal the great plan used by the
Creator—the Systema Naturae. However, he unwittingly laid the framework
for later evolutionary schemes by dividing organisms into a hierarchic series
of taxonomic categories, starting with kingdom and progressing down
through phylum, class, order, family, and genus to species. The naturalists of
the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries likened this hierarchy to a
“tree of life” (Figure 19.1), an analogy that was adopted by Darwin in The
Origin of Species as a means of describing the interconnected evolutionary
histories of living organisms. The classificatory scheme devised by Linnaeus
therefore became reinterpreted as a phylogeny indicating not just the similarities between species but also their evolutionary relationships.

19.1.1 The origins of molecular phylogenetics
Whether the objective is to construct a classification or to infer a phylogeny,
the relevant data are obtained by examining variable characters in the organisms being compared. Originally, these characters were morphological features, but molecular data were introduced at a surprisingly early stage. In
1904, Nuttall used immunological tests to deduce relationships between a
variety of animals, one of his objectives being to place humans in their correct
evolutionary position relative to other primates, an issue that we will return to
in Section 19.3.1. Nuttall’s work showed that molecular data can be used in
phylogenetics, but the approach was not widely adopted until the late 1950s,
the delay being due largely to technical limitations, but also partly because
classification and phylogenetics had to undergo their own evolutionary
changes before the value of molecular data could be fully appreciated.

Phenetics and cladistics require large datasets
These changes began in 1957 with the introduction of phenetics, a novel phylogenetic method which challenged the prevailing view that classifications
should be based on comparisons between a limited number of characters
that taxonomists believed to be important for one reason or another.
Pheneticists argued that classifications should encompass as many variable
characters as possible, these characters being scored numerically and analyzed by rigorous mathematical methods.
The introduction of phenetics was followed ten years later by another new
phylogenetic approach called cladistics, which also emphasizes the need for
large datasets but differs from phenetics in that it does not give equal weight
to all characters. The argument is that in order to infer the branching order in
a phylogeny it is necessary to distinguish those characters that provide a good
indication of evolutionary relationships from other characters that might be
misleading. This might appear to take us back to the prephenetic approach
but cladistics is much less subjective: rather than making assumptions about
which characters are “important,” cladistics demands that the evolutionary
relevance of individual characters be defined. In particular, errors in the

branching pattern within a phylogeny are minimized by recognizing two
types of anomalous data:
G

Convergent evolution, or homoplasy, occurs when the same character
state evolves in two separate lineages. For example, both birds and bats
possess wings, but bats are more closely related to wingless mammals
than they are to birds (Figure 19.2A). The character state “possession of
wings” is therefore misleading in the context of vertebrate phylogeny.

G

Ancestral character states must be distinguished from derived character
states. An ancestral (or plesiomorphic) character state is one possessed
by a remote common ancestor of a group of organisms, an example being
five toes in vertebrates. A derived (or apomorphic) character state is one
that evolved from the ancestral state in a more recent common ancestor,
and so is seen in only a subset of the species in the group being studied.
Among vertebrates, the possession of a single toe, as displayed by modern
horses, is a derived character state (Figure 19.2B). If we did not realize this
then we might conclude that humans are more closely related to lizards,
which like us have five toes, rather than to horses.

Large datasets can be obtained by studying molecular characters
Phenetics and cladistics have had an uneasy relationship over the last 40 years.
Most of today’s evolutionary biologists favor cladistics, even though a strictly
cladistic approach throws up some apparently counterintuitive results, a
notable example being the conclusion that the birds should not have their
own class (Aves) but be included among the reptiles. But both methodologies
share a need for large mathematical datasets as the basic material from which
phylogenies are reconstructed. The difficulty in obtaining datasets of this type
when morphological characters are used was one of the main driving forces
behind the gradual shift toward use of molecular data, which have three
advantages compared with other types of phylogenetic information:
G

G

When molecular data are used, a single experiment can provide information on many different characters: in a DNA sequence, for example, every
nucleotide position is a character with four character states—A, C, G, and
T. Large molecular datasets can therefore be generated relatively quickly.
Molecular character states are unambiguous: A, C, G, and T are easily recognizable and one nucleotide cannot be confused with another. Some

morphological characters, such as those based on the shape of a structure, can be less easy to distinguish because of overlaps between different
character states.
G

Molecular data are easily converted to numerical form and hence are
amenable to mathematical and statistical analysis.

The sequences of protein and DNA molecules provide the most detailed and
unambiguous data for molecular phylogenetics, but techniques for protein
sequencing did not become routine until the late 1960s, and rapid DNA
sequencing was not developed until 10 years after that. Early studies therefore depended largely on indirect assessments of DNA or protein variations,
using one of three methods:

- Gly - Ala - Ile - Leu - Asp - Arg -GGAGCCATATTAGATAGA-GGAGCAATTTTTGATAGA- Gly - Ala - Ile - Phe - Asp - Arg -

Figure 19.3 DNA yields more
phylogenetic information than protein.
The two DNA sequences differ at three
positions but the amino acid sequences
differ at only one position. These positions
are indicated by blue dots. Two of the
nucleotide substitutions are therefore
synonymous and one is nonsynonymous
(see Figure 16.11).

G

Immunological data, such as those obtained by Nuttall, involve measurements of the amount of cross-reactivity seen when an antibody specific
for a protein from one organism is mixed with the same protein from a different organism. Remember that in Section 14.2.1 we learned that antibodies are immunoglobulin proteins that help to protect the body against
invasion by bacteria, viruses, and other unwanted substances by binding
to these “antigens.” Proteins also act as antigens, so if human b-globin, for
example, is injected into a rabbit then the rabbit makes an antibody that
binds specifically to that protein. The antibody will also cross-react with
b-globins from other vertebrates, because these b-globins have similar
structures to the human version. The degree of cross-reactivity depends
on how similar the b-globin being tested is to the human protein, providing the similarity data used in the phylogenetic analysis.

G

Protein electrophoresis is used to compare the electrophoretic properties,
and hence degree of similarity, of proteins from different organisms. This
technique has proved useful for comparing closely related species and
variations between members of a single species.

G

DNA–DNA hybridization data are obtained by hybridizing DNA samples
from the two organisms being compared. The DNA samples are denatured
and mixed together so that hybrid molecules form. The stability of these
hybrid molecules depends on the degree of similarity between the
nucleotide sequences of the two DNAs, and is measured by determining
the melting temperature (see Figure 3.8), a stable hybrid having a higher
melting temperature than a less stable one. The melting temperatures
obtained with DNAs from different pairs of organisms provide the data
used in the phylogenetic analysis.

By the end of the 1960s these indirect methods had been supplemented with
an increasing number of protein sequence studies, and during the 1980s
DNA-based phylogenetics began to be carried out on a large scale. Protein
sequences are still used today in some contexts, but DNA has now become by
far the predominant molecule studied. This is mainly because DNA yields
more phylogenetic information than protein, the nucleotide sequences of a
pair of homologous genes having a higher information content than the
amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins, because mutations that
result in synonymous changes alter the DNA sequence but do not affect the
amino acid sequence (Figure 19.3). Entirely novel information can also be
obtained by DNA sequence analysis because variability in both the coding
and noncoding regions of the genome can be examined. The ease with which
DNA samples for sequence analysis can be prepared by PCR (Section 2.3) is

Genomes Chapter 19

another key reason behind the predominance of DNA analysis in modern
molecular phylogenetics.
As well as DNA sequences, molecular phylogenetics also makes use of DNA
markers such as RFLPs, SSLPs, and SNPs (Section 3.2.2), particularly for
intraspecific studies such as those aimed at understanding migrations of prehistoric human populations (Section 19.3.2). Later in this chapter we will
consider various examples of the use of both DNA sequences and DNA markers in molecular phylogenetics, but first we must make a more detailed study
of the methodology used in this area of genome research.

19.2 The Reconstruction of DNA-based
Phylogenetic Trees
The objective of most phylogenetic studies is to reconstruct the tree-like pattern that describes the evolutionary relationships between the organisms
being studied. Before examining the methodology for doing this, we must
first take a closer look at a typical tree in order to familiarize ourselves with
the basic terminology used in phylogenetic analysis.

19.2.1 The key features of DNA-based phylogenetic trees
A typical phylogenetic tree is shown in Figure 19.4A. This tree could have
been reconstructed from any type of comparative data, but as we are interested in DNA sequences we will assume that the tree shows the relationships
between four homologous genes, called A, B, C, and D. The topology of this
tree comprises four external nodes, each representing one of the four genes
that we have compared, and two internal nodes representing ancestral
genes. The lengths of the branches indicate the degree of difference between
the genes represented by the nodes. The degree of difference is calculated
when the sequences are compared, as described in Section 19.2.2.
The tree in Figure 19.4A is unrooted, which means that it is only an illustration of the relationships between A, B, C, and D and does not tell us anything
about the series of evolutionary events that led to these genes. Five different
evolutionary pathways are possible, each depicted by a different rooted tree,
as shown in Figure 19.4B. To distinguish between them the phylogenetic
analysis must include at least one outgroup, this being a homologous gene
that we know is less closely related to A, B, C, and D than these four genes are
to each other. The outgroup enables the root of the tree to be located and the
correct evolutionary pathway to be identified. The criteria used when choosing an outgroup depend very much on the type of analysis that is being carried out. As an example, let us say that the four homologous genes in our tree
come from human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan. We could then use as
an outgroup the homologous gene from another primate, such as the
baboon, which we know from paleontological evidence branched away from
the lineage leading to human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan before the
time of the common ancestor of those four species (Figure 19.5).
The phylogenetic tree constructed from primate genes displays a relatively
simple pattern of relationships. Most trees are more complex and we need
terms to distinguish between the different types of relationship that are seen
(Figure 19.6). Two or more sequences are said to be monophyletic if they are

derived from a single common ancestral DNA sequence. A group of monophyletic sequences is called a clade if it comprises all of the sequences
included in the analysis that are descended from the ancestral sequence at the
root of the clade. If the group excludes some members of the clade then that
group is paraphyletic. Alternatively, if two or more DNA sequences are derived
from different ancestral sequences then that group is said to be polyphyletic.
We refer to the rooted tree that we obtain by phylogenetic analysis as an
inferred tree. This is to emphasize that it depicts the series of evolutionary
events that are inferred from the data that were analyzed, and may not be the
same as the true tree, the one that depicts the actual series of events that
occurred. Sometimes we can be fairly confident that the inferred tree is the
true tree, but most phylogenetic data analyses are prone to uncertainties
which are likely to result in the inferred tree differing in some respects from
the true tree. In Section 19.2.2 we will look at the various methods used to
assign degrees of confidence to the branching pattern in an inferred tree, and
later in the chapter we will examine some of the controversies that have
arisen as a result of the imprecise nature of phylogenetic analysis.

Gene trees are not the same as species trees
The tree shown in Figure 19.5 illustrates a common type of molecular phylogenetics project, where the objective is to use a gene tree, reconstructed from
comparisons between the sequences of orthologous genes (those derived
from the same ancestral sequence), to make inferences about the evolutionary history of the species from which the genes are obtained. The assumption
is that the gene tree, based on molecular data with all its advantages, will be
a more accurate and less ambiguous representation of the species tree than
that obtainable by morphological comparisons. This assumption is often correct, but it does not mean that the gene tree is the same as the species tree.

they share a common ancestor that lived

a clade as they all derive from a single
common ancestor that lived 13 million
years ago. The indicated group is
paraphyletic as it excludes sheep and goats,
which share the same common ancestor as

gave rise to sheep, goats and cattle, and for
horses the ancestor is from 75 million years
ago and also gave rise to cats and dogs.

For that to be the case, the internal nodes in the gene and species trees would
have to be precisely equivalent. Usually they are not equivalent, because:

An internal node in a gene tree represents the divergence of an ancestral
gene into two alleles with different DNA sequences: this occurs by mutation (Figure 19.7A).

An internal node in a species tree represents a speciation event (Figure
19.7B): this occurs by the population of the ancestral species splitting into
two groups that are unable to interbreed, often because they become geographically isolated.

The important point is that these two events—mutation and speciation—are
not expected to occur at the same time. For example, the mutation event
could precede the speciation. This would mean that, to begin with, both alleles of the gene are present in the unsplit population of the ancestral species
(Figure 19.8). When the population split occurs, it is likely that both alleles
will still be present in each of the two resulting groups. After the split, the new
populations evolve independently. One possibility is that the results of random genetic drift (Section 19.3.2) lead to one allele being lost from one population and the other being lost from the other population. This establishes
the two separate genetic lineages that we infer from phylogenetic analysis of
the gene sequences present in the modern species that result from the continued evolution of the two populations.

Mutation

TIME

How do these considerations affect the equivalence of the gene and species
trees? There are various implications, two of which are as follows:
G

If a molecular clock (Section 19.2.2) is used to date the time at which the
gene divergence took place, then it cannot be assumed that this is also the
time of the speciation event. If the node being dated is ancient, say 50 million or more years ago, then the error may not be noticeable. But if the
speciation event is relatively recent, as when primates are being compared, then the date for the gene divergence might be significantly different to that for the speciation event.

G

If the first speciation event is quickly followed by a second speciation
event in one of the two resulting populations, then the branching order of
the gene tree might be different from that of the species tree. This can
occur if the genes in the modern species are derived from alleles that had
already appeared before the first of the two speciation events, as illustrated in Figure 19.9.

Figure 19.9 A gene tree can have a
different branching order from a species
tree. In this example, the gene has
undergone two mutations in the ancestral
species, the first mutation giving rise to the
“red” allele and the second to the “blue”
allele. Random genetic drift in association
with the two subsequent speciation events
results in the green allele lineage appearing
in species A, the blue allele lineage in
species B, and the red allele lineage in
species C. Molecular phylogenetics based
on the gene sequences will reveal that the
green–red split occurred before the
red–blue split, giving the gene tree shown
on the right. However, the actual species
tree is different, as shown on the left.

19.2.2 Tree reconstruction
In this section we will look at how tree reconstruction is carried out with DNA
sequences, concentrating on the four main steps in the procedure:
G

Aligning the DNA sequences and obtaining the comparative data that will
be used to reconstruct the tree.

G

Converting the comparative data into a reconstructed tree.

G

Assessing the accuracy of the reconstructed tree.

G

Using a molecular clock to assign dates to branch points within the tree.

Sequence alignment is the essential preliminary to tree
reconstruction
The data used in reconstruction of a DNA-based phylogenetic tree are
obtained by comparing nucleotide sequences. These comparisons are made
by aligning the sequences so that nucleotide differences can be scored. This
is the critical part of the entire enterprise because if the alignment is incorrect
then the resulting tree will definitely not be the true tree.
The first issue to consider is whether the sequences being aligned are homologous. If they are homologous then they must, by definition, be derived from
a common ancestral sequence (Section 5.2.1) and so there is a sound basis for
the phylogenetic study. If they are not homologous then they do not share a
common ancestor. The phylogenetic analysis will find a common ancestor

The Reconstruction of DNA-based Phylogenetic Trees
(A) A simple sequence alignment

because the methods used for tree reconstruction always produce a tree of
some description, even if the data are completely erroneous, but the resulting
tree will have no biological relevance. With some DNA sequences—for example, the b-globin genes of different vertebrates—there is little difficulty in
being sure that the sequences being compared are homologous, but this is
not always the case, and one of the commonest errors that arises during phylogenetic analysis is the inadvertent inclusion of a nonhomologous sequence.
Once it has been established that two DNA sequences are indeed homologous, the next step is to align the sequences so that homologous nucleotides
can be compared. With some pairs of sequences this is a trivial exercise
(Figure 19.10A), but it is not so easy if the sequences are relatively dissimilar
and/or have diverged by the accumulation of insertions and deletions as well
as point mutations. Insertions and deletions cannot be distinguished from
one another when pairs of sequences are compared so we refer to them as
indels. Placing indels at their correct positions is often the most difficult part
of sequence alignment (Figure 19.10B).
Some pairs of sequences can be aligned reliably by eye. For more complex
pairs, alignment might be possible by the dot matrix method (Figure 19.11).
The two sequences are written out on the x- and y-axes of a graph, and dots
placed in the squares of the graph paper at positions corresponding to identical nucleotides in the two sequences. The alignment is indicated by a diagonal series of dots, broken by empty squares where the sequences have
nucleotide differences, and shifting from one column to another at places
where indels occur.
More rigorous mathematical approaches to sequence alignment have also
been devised. The first of these is the similarity approach, which aims to
maximize the number of matched nucleotides—those that are identical in
the two sequences. The complementary approach is the distance method,
in which the objective is to minimize the number of mismatches. Often the
two procedures will identify the same alignment as being the best one.
Usually the comparison involves more than just two sequences, meaning that
a multiple alignment is required. This can rarely be done effectively with pen
and paper so, as in all steps in a phylogenetic analysis, a computer program
is used. For multiple alignments, Clustal is often the most popular choice.
Clustal and other software packages for phylogenetic analysis are described
in Technical Note 19.1.

Converting alignment data into a phylogenetic tree
Once the sequences have been aligned accurately, an attempt can be made to
reconstruct the phylogenetic tree. To date, nobody has devised a perfect
method for tree reconstruction, and several different procedures are used
routinely. Comparative tests have been run with artificial data, for which the
true tree is known, but these have failed to identify any particular method as
being better than any of the others.
The main distinction between the different tree-building methods is the way
in which the multiple sequence alignment is converted into numerical data
that can be analyzed mathematically in order to reconstruct the tree. The
simplest approach is to convert the sequence information into a distance
matrix, which is simply a table showing the evolutionary distances between

Technical Note 19.1 Phylogenetic analysis
Software packages for construction of phylogenetic trees
Few sets of DNA sequences are simple enough to be converted into phylogenetic trees entirely by hand. Virtually all
research in this area is carried out using computers with
the aid of any one of a variety of software packages
designed specifically for one or other of the steps in tree
reconstruction.
One of the easiest to use and most popular packages is
Clustal, which was originally written in 1988 and has undergone several upgrades in the intervening years. Clustal is primarily a program for carrying out multiple alignments of protein or DNA sequences, which it is able to do very effectively
provided that the sequences being compared do not contain extensive internal repeat motifs. Clustal is usually used
in conjunction with NJplot, a simple program for tree reconstruction by the neighbor-joining method. One important

advantage of Clustal and NJplot is that they do not require
huge amounts of computer memory and so can be run on
small PCs or Macintosh computers.
More comprehensive software packages enable the
researcher to choose between a variety of different methods for tree reconstruction and to carry out more sophisticated types of phylogenetic analysis. The most widely used
of these packages are PAUP and PHYLIP. The tree-building
programs in PAUP are often looked upon as the most
accurate ones currently available and are able to handle
relatively large datasets. PHYLIP has the advantage of
including a number of software tools not readily available
from other sources. Other popular packages include PAML,
MacClade, and HENNIG86.

all pairs of sequences in the dataset (Figure 19.12). The evolutionary distance
is calculated from the number of nucleotide differences between a pair of
sequences and is used to establish the lengths of the branches connecting
these two sequences in the reconstructed tree. In the example shown in
Figure 19.12 the evolutionary distance is expressed as the number of
nucleotide differences per nucleotide site for each sequence pair. For example, sequences 1 and 2 are 20 nucleotides in length and have four differences,
corresponding to an evolutionary distance of 4/20 = 0.2. Note that this analysis assumes that there are no multiple substitutions (also called multiple
hits). Multiple substitution occurs when a single site undergoes two or more
changes (e.g., the ancestral sequence ...ATGT... gives rise to two modern
sequences: ...AGGT... and ...ACGT... ). There is only one nucleotide difference
between the two modern sequences, but there have been two nucleotide substitutions. If this multiple hit is not recognized then the evolutionary distance
between the two modern sequences will be significantly underestimated. To
avoid this problem, distance matrices for phylogenetic analysis are usually
constructed using mathematical methods that include statistical devices for
estimating the amount of multiple substitution that has occurred.

The Reconstruction of DNA-based Phylogenetic Trees

The neighbor-joining method is a popular tree-building procedure that uses
the distance matrix approach. To begin the reconstruction, it is initially
assumed that there is just one internal node from which branches leading to
all the DNA sequences radiate in a star-like pattern (Figure 19.13). This is virtually impossible in evolutionary terms but the pattern is just a starting point.
Next, a pair of sequences is chosen at random, removed from the star, and
attached to a second internal node, connected by a branch to the center of the
star. The distance matrix is then used to calculate the total branch length in
this new “tree.” The sequences are then returned to their original positions and
another pair attached to the second internal node, and again the total branch
length is calculated. This operation is repeated until all the possible pairs have
been examined, enabling the combination that gives the tree with the shortest
total branch length to be identified. This pair of sequences will be neighbors in
the final tree; in the interim, they are combined into a single unit, creating a
new star with one branch fewer than the original one. The whole process of
pair selection and tree-length calculation is now repeated so that a second pair
of neighboring sequences is identified, and then repeated again so that a third
pair is located, and so on. The result is a complete reconstructed tree.
The advantage of the neighbor-joining method is that the data handling is
relatively easy to carry out, largely because the information content of the
multiple alignment has been reduced to its simplest form. The disadvantage
is that some of the information is lost, in particular that pertaining to the
identities of the ancestral and derived nucleotides (equivalent to ancestral
and derived character states, defined in Section 19.1.1) at each position in the
multiple alignment. The maximum parsimony method takes account of this
information, utilizing it to recreate the series of nucleotide changes that are
most likely to have resulted in the pattern of variation revealed by the multiple alignment. Parsimony was originally a philosophical term stating that,
when deciding between competing hypotheses, preference should be given
to the one that involves the fewest unconnected assumptions. In molecular
phylogenetics, parsimony is an approach that decides between different tree
topologies by identifying the one that involves the shortest evolutionary
pathway, this being the pathway that requires the smallest number of
nucleotide changes to go from the ancestral sequence, at the root of the tree,
to all the present-day sequences that have been compared. Trees are therefore constructed at random and the number of nucleotide changes that they
involve calculated until all possible topologies have been examined and the
one requiring the smallest number of steps identified. This is presented as the
most likely inferred tree.
The maximum parsimony method is more rigorous in its approach compared
with the neighbor-joining method, but this increase in rigor inevitably
extends the amount of data handling that is involved. This is a significant
problem because the number of possible trees that must be scrutinized
increases rapidly as more sequences are added to the dataset. With just five
sequences there are only 15 possible unrooted trees, but for ten sequences
there are 2,027,025 unrooted trees and for 50 sequences the number exceeds
the number of atoms in the universe. Even with a high-speed computer it is
not possible to check every one of these trees in a reasonable time, if at all, so
often the maximum parsimony method is unable to carry out a comprehensive analysis. The same is true with many of the other more sophisticated
methods for tree reconstruction.

New alignment

Figure 19.14 Constructing a new
multiple alignment in order to bootstrap
a phylogenetic tree. The new alignment is
built up by taking columns at random from
the real alignment. Note that the same
column can be sampled more than once.

The limitations to the methods used in phylogenetic reconstruction lead
inevitably to questions about the veracity of the resulting trees. Statistical
tests of the accuracy of a reconstructed tree have been devised, but these are
necessarily complex because a tree is geometric rather than numeric, and the
accuracy of one part of the topology may be more or less than the accuracy of
the other parts.
The routine method for assigning confidence limits to different branch points
within a tree is to carry out a bootstrap analysis. To do this we need a second
multiple alignment that is different from, but equivalent to, the real alignment.
This new alignment is built up by taking columns, at random, from the real
alignment, as illustrated in Figure 19.14. The new alignment therefore comprises sequences that are different from the original, but it has a similar pattern
of variability. This means that when we use the new alignment in tree reconstruction we do not simply reproduce the original analysis, but we should
obtain the same tree.
In practice, 1000 new alignments are created so 1000 replicate trees are reconstructed. A bootstrap value can then be assigned to each internal node in the
original tree, this value being the number of times that the branch pattern
seen at that node was reproduced in the replicate trees. If the bootstrap value
is greater than 700/1000 then we can assign a reasonable degree of confidence to the topology at that particular internal node.

Molecular clocks enable the time of divergence of ancestral
sequences to be estimated
When we carry out a phylogenetic analysis our primary objective is to infer
the pattern of the evolutionary relationships between the DNA sequences
that are being compared. These relationships are revealed by the topology of
the tree that is reconstructed. Often we also have a secondary objective: to
discover when the ancestral sequences diverged to give the modern
sequences. This information is interesting in the context of genome evolution, as we discovered when we looked at the evolutionary history of the
human globin genes (see Figure 18.8). The information is even more interesting on occasions when we are able to equate a gene tree with a species tree,
because now the times at which the ancestral sequences diverged approximate to the dates of speciation events.
To assign dates to branch points in a phylogenetic tree we must make use of
a molecular clock. The molecular clock hypothesis, first proposed in the early
1960s, states that nucleotide substitutions (or amino acid substitutions if protein sequences are being compared) occur at a constant rate. This means that
the degree of difference between two sequences can be used to assign a date
to the time at which their ancestral sequence diverged. However, to be able to
do this, the molecular clock must be calibrated so that we know how many
nucleotide substitutions to expect per million years. Calibration is usually
achieved by reference to the fossil record. For example, fossils suggest that the
most recent common ancestor of humans and orangutans lived 13 million
years ago. To calibrate the human molecular clock we therefore compare
human and orangutan DNA sequences to determine the amount of
nucleotide substitution that has occurred, and then divide this figure by 13,
followed by 2, to obtain a rate of substitution per million years (Figure 19.15).

The Reconstruction of DNA-based Phylogenetic Trees

At one time it was thought that there might be a universal molecular clock
that applied to all genes in all organisms. Now we realize that molecular
clocks are different in different organisms and are variable even within a single organism. The differences between organisms might be the result of generation times, because a species with a short generation time is likely to accumulate DNA replication errors at a faster rate than a species with a longer
generation time. This probably explains the observation that rodents have a
faster molecular clock than primates. Within a single genome the variations
are as follows:
G

Nonsynonymous substitutions occur at a slower rate than synonymous
ones. This is because a mutation that results in a change in the amino acid
sequence of a protein might be deleterious to the organism, so the accumulation of nonsynonymous mutations in the population is reduced by
the processes of natural selection. This means that when gene sequences
in two species are compared, there are usually fewer nonsynonymous
than synonymous substitutions.

G

The molecular clock for mitochondrial genes is faster than that for genes
in the nuclear genome. This is probably because mitochondria lack many
of the DNA repair systems that operate on nuclear genes.

G

Molecular clocks appear to have increased in speed over the last 1–2 million years. This is thought to be an artifact, due perhaps to the persistence
during this period of mutations that are only slightly deleterious and
which are therefore removed relatively slowly by natural selection. The
apparent acceleration means that inaccuracies might arise if a molecular
clock is calibrated against relatively ancient events in the fossil record and
then used to assign dates to more recent events.

and the number per million years is
x/(2 ¥ 13).

Despite these complications, molecular clocks have become an immensely
valuable adjunct to tree reconstruction, as we will see in Section 19.3 when we
look at some typical molecular phylogenetics projects.

Standard tree reconstruction is not appropriate for all DNA
sequence datasets
Conventional tree building assumes that the relationships between a group of
DNA sequences can be described by a simple branching pattern. This assumption is not always correct. For example, if a group of sequences are able to
recombine then new sequences might be generated that share features of, and
indeed are descendants of, pairs of ancestral sequences that occupy distant
positions in a conventional phylogenetic tree (Figure 19.16A). If the products
of recombination are included in the tree then the dichotomous branching

pattern begins to break down and the relationships become difficult to distinguish. This is a particular problem when attempts are made to determine the
evolutionary relationships between the members of a multigene family, as
these sequences reside in a single genome, possibly as a tandem array, and it
is therefore possible that recombination between them has occurred in the
past. Conventional tree building is also inappropriate if ancestral sequences,
represented by internal nodes, still exist (Figure 19.16B). This is rarely a problem when the genes being compared come from different species, as the internal nodes now represent sequences that were present in ancestral species that
are now extinct, but it is very relevant when the sequences being compared are
taken from a single population with a short evolutionary history. This problem
often arises in studies of recent human evolution.

Figure 19.17 Phylogenetic analysis by
network construction. Panel (A) shows a
multiple alignment from which the network
is constructed, with dots indicating identities
with Sequence 1. (B) The network is
constructed as follows. (i) Sequence 1 is
used as the starting point. (ii) Sequence 2
differs from Sequence 1 at four positions
and is linked to Sequence 1 by a line in the
network. (iii) Sequence 3 differs from
Sequence 1 at one position, this position
different from any of those in Sequence 2.
Sequence 3 is therefore linked directly to
Sequence 1. (iv) Sequence 4 shares with
Sequence 3 the CÆT substitution at
position 11, but has an additional
substitution at position 2. The line leading to
Sequence 3 is therefore extended and
Sequence 4 placed at its terminus. (v)
Sequence 5 has one substitution compared
with Sequence 1, this being a unique
substitution not seen so far. Sequence 5 is
therefore linked directly to Sequence 1. (vi)
Similarly, Sequence 6 has three unique
substitutions and is linked directly to
Sequence 1. (vii) Sequence 7 has two
differences from Sequence 1, one of these
being the CÆT at position 11 seen in
Sequences 3 and 4. Sequence 7 therefore
connects directly with Sequence 3. In this
part of the network, the line between
Sequences 1 and 3 represents the
substitution at position 11, that between
Sequences 3 and 4 is the substitution at
position 2, and that between Sequences 3
and 7 is the substitution at position 24. (viii)
Sequence 8 shares with Sequence 7 the
AÆG substitution at position 24, and has a
unique substitution, not seen in any previous
sequence, at position 9. Sequence 8 must
therefore form a branch off a line between
Sequences 1 and 7. This branch creates an
“empty node”, shown as a small dot, which
represents a sequence not present in the
dataset, possibly because it is extinct.

One solution to these problems is to use a network rather than a tree to illustrate the evolutionary relationships between the sequences being examined
(Figure 19.17). A network enables ancestral sequences that still exist to be
identified (such as Sequence 1 in Figure 19.17) and clearly illustrates their
relationship with the sequences descended from them. Sequences that are
extinct (or which exist in the population but are not present in the dataset)
can also be identified. Reticulations in the network, such as that linking
Sequences 1, 3, 7, and 8 in Figure 19.17, are particularly interesting as these
indicate sequences that have arisen either by recombination or by parallel
mutations (homoplasy) in different lineages.
Simple networks can be constructed manually, but their topologies quickly
become complex as more sequences are added (Figure 19.18), especially if all

possible relationships between sequences are included. Algorithms for
reducing the complexity of a network, without losing phylogenetic information, have therefore been devised. These include pruning methods which
assign weights to the various pathways between pairs of sequences and
remove those links which are less likely to represent true relationships.

19.3 The Applications of Molecular Phylogenetics
Molecular phylogenetics has grown in stature since the start of the 1990s,
largely because of the development of more rigorous methods for tree building, combined with the explosion of DNA sequence information obtained initially by PCR analysis and more recently by genome projects. The importance
of molecular phylogenetics has also been enhanced by the successful application of tree reconstruction and other phylogenetic techniques to some of
the more perplexing issues in biology. In this final section we will survey some
of these successes.

19.3.1 Examples of the use of phylogenetic trees
First, we will consider two projects that illustrate the various ways in which
conventional tree reconstruction is being used in modern molecular biology.

DNA phylogenetics has clarified the evolutionary relationships
between humans and other primates
Darwin was the first biologist to speculate on the evolutionary relationships
between humans and other primates. His view—that humans are closely
related to the chimpanzee, gorilla, and orangutan—was controversial when it
was first proposed and fell out of favor, even among evolutionists, in the following decades. Indeed, biologists were among the most ardent advocates of
an anthropocentric view of our place in the animal world.
From studies of fossils, paleontologists had concluded prior to 1960 that
chimpanzees and gorillas are our closest relatives but that the relationship
was distant, the split, leading to humans on the one hand and chimpanzees
and gorillas on the other, having occurred some 15 million years ago. The first
detailed molecular data, obtained by immunological studies in the 1960s,
confirmed that humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas do indeed form a single
clade, but suggested that the relationship is much closer, a molecular clock
indicating that this split occurred only 5 million years ago. This was one of the
first attempts to apply a molecular clock to phylogenetic data and the result
was, quite naturally, treated with some suspicion. In fact, an acrimonious
debate opened up between paleontologists, who believed in the ancient split
indicated by the fossil evidence, and biologists, who had more confidence in
the recent date suggested by the molecular data. This debate was eventually
“won” by the molecular biologists, whose view that the split occurred about 5
million years ago became generally accepted.
As more and more molecular data were obtained, the difficulties in establishing the exact pattern of the evolutionary events that led to humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas became apparent. Comparisons of the mitochondrial
genomes of the three species by restriction mapping (Section 3.3.1) and DNA
sequencing suggested that the chimpanzee and gorilla are more closely related
to each other than either is to humans (Figure 19.19A), whereas DNA–DNA
hybridization data supported a closer relationship between humans and

but these were reduced to the 655 shown
here by pruning, as described in the text.

chimpanzees (Figure 19.19B). The reason for these conflicting results is the
close similarity between DNA sequences in the three species, the differences
being less than 3% for even the most divergent regions of the genomes (Section
18.4). This makes it difficult to establish relationships unambiguously.
The solution to the problem has been to make comparisons between as many
different genes as possible and to target those loci that are expected to show
the greatest amount of dissimilarity. By 1997, 14 different molecular datasets
had been obtained, including sequences of variable loci such as pseudogenes
and noncoding sequences. Analysis of these datasets confirmed that the
chimpanzee is the closest relative to humans, with our lineages diverging
4.6–5.0 million years ago. The gorilla is a slightly more distant cousin, its lineage having diverged from the human–chimpanzee one between 0.3 million
and 2.8 million years earlier (Figure 19.19C).

The origins of AIDS
The global epidemic of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) has
touched everyone’s lives. AIDS is caused by human immunodeficiency virus
1 (HIV-1), a retrovirus (Section 9.1.2) that infects cells involved in the immune
response. The demonstration in the early 1980s that HIV-1 is responsible for
AIDS was quickly followed by speculation about the origin of the disease.
Speculation centered around the discovery that similar immunodeficiency
viruses are present in primates such as the chimpanzee, sooty mangabey,
mandrill, and various monkeys. These simian immunodeficiency viruses
(SIVs) are not pathogenic in their normal hosts but it was thought that if one
had become transferred to humans then within this new species the virus
might have acquired new properties, such as the ability to cause disease and
to spread rapidly through the population.
Retrovirus genomes accumulate mutations relatively quickly because reverse
transcriptase, the enzyme that copies the RNA genome contained in the virus
particle into the DNA version that integrates into the host genome (see
Section 9.1.2), lacks an efficient proofreading activity (Section 15.2.2) and so
tends to make errors when it carries out RNA-dependent DNA synthesis. This
means that the molecular clock runs rapidly in retroviruses, and genomes
that diverged quite recently display sufficient nucleotide dissimilarity for a
phylogenetic analysis to be carried out. Even though the evolutionary period
we are interested in is less than 100 years, HIV and SIV genomes contain sufficient data for their relationships to be inferred by phylogenetic analysis.
The starting point for this phylogenetic analysis is RNA extracted from virus
particles. RT-PCR (see Technical Note 5.1) is therefore used to convert the RNA
into a DNA copy and then to amplify the DNA so that sufficient amounts for
nucleotide sequencing are obtained. Comparison between virus DNA

sequences has resulted in the reconstructed tree shown in Figure 19.20. This
tree has a number of interesting features. First, it shows that different samples
of HIV-1 have slightly different sequences, the samples as a whole forming a
tight cluster, almost a star-like pattern, that radiates from one end of the
unrooted tree. This star-like topology implies that the global AIDS epidemic
began with a very small number of viruses, perhaps just one, which have
spread and diversified since entering the human population. The closest relative to HIV-1 among primates is the SIV of chimpanzees, the implication being
that this virus jumped across the species barrier between chimpanzees and
humans and initiated the AIDS epidemic. However, this epidemic did not
begin immediately: a relatively long, uninterrupted branch links the center of
the HIV-1 radiation with the internal node leading to the relevant SIV
sequence, suggesting that after transmission to humans, HIV-1 underwent a
latent period when it remained restricted to a small part of the global human
population, presumably in Africa, before beginning its rapid spread to other
parts of the world. Other primate SIVs are less closely related to HIV-1, but one,
the SIV from sooty mangabey, clusters in the tree with the second human
immunodeficiency virus, HIV-2. It appears that HIV-2 was transferred to the
human population independently of HIV-1, and from a different simian host.
HIV-2 is also able to cause AIDS, but has not, as yet, become globally epidemic.
An intriguing addition to the HIV/SIV tree was made in 1998 when the RNA of
an HIV-1 isolate from a blood sample taken in 1959 from an African male was
sequenced. The RNA was highly fragmented and only a short DNA sequence
could be obtained, but this was sufficient for the sequence to be placed on the
phylogenetic tree (see Figure 19.20). This sequence, called ZR59, attaches to
the tree by a short branch that emerges from near the center of the HIV-1 radiation. The positioning indicates that the ZR59 sequence represents one of the
earliest versions of HIV-1 and shows that the global spread of HIV-1 was
already underway by 1959. A later and more comprehensive analysis of HIV-1
sequences has suggested that the spread began in the period between 1915
and 1941, with a best estimate of 1931. Pinning down the date in this way has
enabled epidemiologists to begin an investigation of the historic and social
conditions that might have been responsible for the start of the AIDS epidemic.

19.3.2 Molecular phylogenetics as a tool in the study of
human prehistory
Now we will turn our attention to the use of molecular phylogenetics in
intraspecific studies: the study of the evolutionary history of members of the
same species. We could choose any one of several different organisms to illustrate the approaches and applications of intraspecific studies, but many people look on Homo sapiens as the most interesting organism so we will investigate how molecular phylogenetics is being used to deduce the origins of
modern humans and the geographic patterns of their recent migrations in
the Old and New Worlds.

Studying genes in populations
In any application of molecular phylogenetics, the genes chosen for analysis
must display variability in the organisms being studied. If there is no variability then there is no phylogenetic information. This presents a problem in
intraspecific studies because the organisms being compared are all members
of the same species and so share a great deal of genetic similarity, even if the
species has split into populations that interbreed only intermittently. This

means that the DNA sequences that are used in the phylogenetic analysis
must be the most variable ones that are available. In humans there are three
main possibilities.
G

Multiallelic genes, such as members of the HLA family (Section 3.2.1),
which exist in many different sequence forms.

G

Microsatellites, which evolve not through mutation but by replication
slippage (Section 16.1.1). Cells do not appear to have any repair mechanism for reversing the effects of replication slippage, so new microsatellite
alleles are generated relatively frequently.

G

Mitochondrial DNA, which as mentioned in Section 19.2.2, accumulates
nucleotide substitutions relatively rapidly because mitochondria lack
many of the repair systems that slow down the molecular clock in the
human nucleus. The mitochondrial DNA variants present in a single
species are called haplogroups.

results of simulations of the frequencies of
a pair of alleles over 100 generations, for
populations containing 20 or 1000
individuals. In both populations, one allele
eventually becomes fixed and the other lost,
but the time taken for this to occur is
greatly influenced by the population size.

Evolutionary Genetics.

It is important to note that it is not the potential for change that is critical to
the application of these loci in phylogenetic analysis, it is the fact that different alleles or haplogroups of each locus coexist in the population as a whole.
The loci are therefore polymorphic and information pertaining to the relationships between different individuals can be obtained by comparing the
combinations of alleles and/or haplogroups that those individuals possess.
New alleles and haplogroups appear in a population because of mutations
that occur in the reproductive cells of individual organisms. Each allele has its
own allele frequency, which changes over time as a result of natural selection and random genetic drift. Natural selection occurs because of differences in fitness (the ability of an organism to survive and reproduce) that,
according to Darwin, result in the “preservation of favourable variations and
the rejection of injurious variations.” Natural selection therefore decreases
the frequencies of alleles that reduce the fitness of an organism, and increases
the frequency of alleles that improve fitness. In reality, few new alleles that
arise in a population have a significant impact on fitness so most are not
affected by natural selection, but their frequencies still change because of
random genetic drift caused by the arbitrary nature of birth, death, and
reproduction (Figure 19.21).
Either because of natural selection or random genetic drift, one allele can
begin to predominate in a population and eventually achieve a frequency of
100%. This allele has now become fixed. Mathematical models predict that
over time different alleles become fixed in a population, resulting in a series
of gene substitutions. If a species splits into two populations that do not
interbreed extensively, then the allele frequencies in the two populations will
change differently so that after a few tens of generations the two populations
will have distinctive genetic features. Eventually, different gene substitutions
occur in the two populations, but even before this happens we can distinguish between them because of the differences in allele frequencies. These
differences can be used to date the time when the population split occurred
and to determine if one or both populations experienced a bottleneck, a
period when the population size became substantially reduced.

The origins of modern humans—out of Africa or not?
It seems reasonably certain that the origin of humans lies in Africa because it is
here that all the oldest prehuman fossils have been found. The paleontological
evidence reveals that hominids first moved outside of Africa over 1 million

years ago, but these were not modern humans, they were an earlier species
called Homo erectus (Figure 19.22). These were the first hominids to become
geographically dispersed, eventually spreading to all parts of the Old World.
The events that followed the dispersal of Homo erectus are controversial.
From comparisons using fossil skulls and bones, paleontologists have concluded that the Homo erectus populations that became located in different
parts of the Old World gave rise to the modern human populations of those
areas by a process called multiregional evolution (Figure 19.23A). There may
have been a certain amount of interbreeding between humans from different
geographic regions but, to a large extent, these various populations remained
separate throughout their evolutionary history.
Doubts about the multiregional hypothesis were first raised by reinterpretations of the fossil evidence and were subsequently brought to a head by publication in 1987 of a phylogenetic tree reconstructed from mitochondrial
RFLP data obtained from 147 humans representing populations from all
parts of the world. The tree (Figure 19.24) confirmed that the ancestors of
modern humans lived in Africa but suggested that they were still there about
200,000 years ago. This inference was made by applying the mitochondrial
molecular clock to the tree, which showed that the ancestral mitochondrial
DNA, the one from which all modern mitochondrial DNAs are descended,
existed between 140,000 and 290,000 years ago. The tree showed that this
mitochondrial genome was located in Africa, so the person who possessed it,
the so-called mitochondrial Eve (she had to be female because mitochondrial DNA is only inherited through the female line), must have been African.
The discovery of mitochondrial Eve prompted a new scenario for the origin of
modern humans. Rather than evolving in parallel throughout the world, as
suggested by the multiregional hypothesis, Out of Africa states that Homo
sapiens originated in Africa, members of this species then moving into the
rest of the Old World between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, displacing the
descendants of Homo erectus that they encountered (see Figure 19.23B).
Such a radical change in thinking inevitably did not go unchallenged. When
the RFLP data were examined by other molecular phylogeneticists it became
clear that the original computer analysis had been flawed, and that several
quite different trees could be reconstructed from the data, some of which did
not have a root in Africa. These criticisms were countered by more detailed
mitochondrial DNA sequence datasets, most of which are compatible with a
relatively recent African origin and so support the Out of Africa hypothesis
rather than multiregional evolution. An interesting complement to “mitochondrial Eve” has been provided by studies of the Y chromosome, which
suggest that “Y chromosome Adam” also lived in Africa some 200,000 years
ago. Of course, this Eve and Adam were not equivalent to the biblical characters and were by no means the only people alive at that time: they were simply the individuals who carried the ancestral mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosomes that gave rise to all the mitochondrial DNAs and Y chromosomes in
existence today. The important point is that these ancestral DNAs were still in
Africa well after the spread of Homo erectus into Eurasia.
The mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome studies appear to provide strong
evidence in support of the Out of Africa theory. But complications have arisen
from examination of nuclear genes other than those on the Y chromosome.

Neandertals are not the ancestors of modern Europeans
Neandertals are extinct hominids who lived in Europe between 300,000 and
30,000 years ago (Figure 19.25). They were descended from the Homo erectus
populations who left Africa about 1 million years ago and, according to the
Out of Africa hypothesis, were displaced when modern humans reached
Europe about 50,000 years ago. Therefore, one prediction of the Out of Africa
hypothesis is that there is no genetic continuity between Neandertals and the
modern humans that live in Europe today. Bearing in mind that the last
Neandertal died out 30,000 years ago, is there any way that we can test this
hypothesis?

Ancient DNA has provided an answer. It has been known for some years that
DNA molecules can survive the death of the organism in which they are contained, being recoverable centuries and possibly millennia later as short,
degraded fragments preserved in bones and other biological remains. There
is never very much ancient DNA in a specimen, possibly no more than a few
hundred genomes in a gram of bone, but that need not concern us because
we can always use PCR to amplify these tiny amounts into larger quantities
from which we can obtain DNA sequences.
The study of ancient DNA has been plagued with controversies over the last
15 years. In the early 1990s there were many reports of ancient human DNA
being detected in bones and other archaeological specimens, but often it
turned out that what had been amplified by PCR was not ancient DNA at all,
but contaminating modern DNA left on the specimen by the archaeologist
who dug it up or by the molecular biologist who carried out the DNA extraction. The worldwide success of the film Jurassic Park led to reports of DNA in
insects preserved in amber and even in dinosaur bones, but all these claims
are now doubted. Many biologists started to wonder if ancient DNA existed at
all, but gradually it became clear that if the work is carried out with extreme
care, it is sometimes possible to extract authentic ancient DNA from specimens up to about 50,000 years old. This is just old enough to include a few
Neandertal bones.
The first Neandertal specimen selected for study was believed to be between
30,000 and 100,000 years old. DNA extraction was carried out with a fragment

this lower branch is purely African it is deduced that the ancestor was also African. The scale
bars at the bottom indicate sequence divergence from which, using the mitochondrial
molecular clock, it is possible to assign dates to the branch points in the tree. The clock

of bone weighing about 400 mg and a technique called quantitative PCR was
used to determine if human DNA molecules were present and, if so, how
many. The results indicated that the bone fragment contained about 1300
copies of the Neandertal mitochondrial genome, enough to suggest that
sequence analysis was worth attempting. PCRs were therefore directed at
what was expected to be the most variable part of the Neandertal mitochondrial genome. Because it was anticipated that the DNA would be broken into
very short pieces, a sequence was built up in sections by carrying out nine
overlapping PCRs, none amplifying more than 170 bp of DNA but together
giving a total length of 377 bp.
A phylogenetic tree was then constructed to compare the sequence obtained
from the Neandertal bone with the sequences of six mitochondrial DNA haplogroups from modern humans (Figure 19.26). The Neandertal sequence was
positioned on a branch of its own, connected to the root of the tree but not
linked directly to any of the modern human sequences. Next, a huge multiple alignment was made in order to compare the Neandertal sequence with
994 sequences from modern humans. The differences were striking. The
Neandertal sequence differed from the modern sequences at an average of
27.2 ± 2.2 nucleotide positions whereas the modern sequences, which came
from all over the world, not just Europe, differed from each other at only

8.0 ± 3.1 positions. Similar results were obtained when mitochondrial DNA
from a second Neandertal skeleton was examined. The degree of difference
between Neandertal and modern European DNA is incompatible with the
notion that modern Europeans are descended from Neandertals and
strongly supports the Out of Africa hypothesis. Supporters of multiregional
evolution are not convinced, however, and the debate over modern human
origins continues.

The patterns of more recent migrations into Europe are also
controversial
By whatever evolutionary pathway, modern humans were present throughout most of Europe by 40,000 years ago. This is clear from the fossil and
archaeological records. The next controversial issue in human prehistory
concerns whether these populations were displaced about 30,000 years later
by other humans migrating into Europe from the Middle East.
The question centers on the process by which agriculture spread into Europe.
The transition from hunting and gathering to farming occurred in the Middle
East some 9000–10,000 years ago, when early Neolithic villagers began to cultivate crops such as wheat and barley. After becoming established in the
Middle East, farming spread into Asia, Europe, and North Africa. By searching
for evidence of agriculture at archaeological sites, for example by looking for
the remains of cultivated plants or for implements used in farming, it has
been possible to trace the expansion of farming along two routes through
Europe, one around the coast to Italy and Spain and the second through the
Danube and Rhine valleys to northern Europe (Figure 19.27).
How did farming spread? The simplest explanation is that farmers migrated
from one part of Europe to another, taking with them their implements, animals, and crops, and displacing the indigenous preagricultural communities
that were present in Europe at that time. This wave of advance model was initially favored by geneticists because of the results of a large-scale analysis of

Figure 19.27 The spread of agriculture
from the Middle East to Europe. The darkgreen area is the “Fertile Crescent,” the area
of the Middle East where many of today’s
crops—wheat, barley, and so on—grow wild
and where these plants are thought to have
first been taken into cultivation.

the allele frequencies for 95 nuclear genes in populations from across Europe.
Such a large and complex dataset cannot be analyzed in any meaningful way
by conventional tree building but instead has to be examined by more
advanced statistical methods, ones based more in population biology than
phylogenetics. One such procedure is principal component analysis, which
attempts to identify in a dataset patterns that correspond to an uneven geographic distribution of alleles, an uneven distribution possibly being indicative of a past population movement. The most striking pattern within the
European dataset, accounting for about 28% of the total genetic variation, is
a gradation of allele frequencies across Europe (Figure 19.28). This pattern
implies that a migration of people occurred either from the Middle East to
northeast Europe, or in the opposite direction. Because the former coincides
with the expansion of farming, as revealed by the archaeological record, this
first principal component was looked upon as providing strong support for
the wave of advance model.
The analysis looked convincing but two criticisms were raised. The first was
that the data provided no indication of when the inferred migration took
place, so the link between the first principal component and the spread of
agriculture was based solely on the pattern of the allele gradation, not on any
complementary evidence relating to the period when this gradation was set
up. The second criticism arose because of the results of a second study of
European human populations, one that did include a time dimension. This
study looked at mitochondrial DNA haplogroups in 821 individuals from various populations across Europe. It failed to confirm the gradation of allele frequencies detected in the nuclear DNA dataset, and instead suggested that
European populations have remained relatively static over the last 20,000
years. A refinement of this work led to the discovery that eleven mitochondrial DNA haplogroups predominate in the modern European population.
These eleven haplogroups are a subset of the 100 or so known throughout the
world (Figure 19.29). Most of these haplogroups are associated with particular geographic regions and detailed statistical analysis of their distributions
and relationships can be used to infer their times of origin, which for the
European haplogroups are thought to indicate the date at which each one
entered Europe (Figure 19.30). The most ancient haplogroup, called U, first
appeared in Europe approximately 50,000 years ago, coinciding with the
period when, according to the archaeological record, the first modern
humans moved into the continent as the ice sheets withdrew to the north at
the end of the last major glaciation. The youngest haplogroups, J and T1,
which at 9000 years in age could correspond to the origins of agriculture, are
possessed by just 8.3% of the modern European population, suggesting that
the spread of farming into Europe was not the huge wave of advance indicated by the principal component study. Instead, it is now thought that farming was brought into Europe by a smaller group of “pioneers” who interbred
with the existing prefarming communities rather than displacing them.

Prehistoric human migrations into the New World
Finally we will examine the completely different set of controversies surrounding the hypotheses regarding the patterns of human migration that led
to the first entry of people into the New World. There is no evidence for the
spread of Homo erectus into the Americas, so it is presumed that humans did
not enter the New World until after modern Homo sapiens had evolved in, or
migrated into, Asia. The Bering Strait between Asia and North America is quite

land bridge itself but in the areas that are now Alaska and northwest Canada.

Also, the glacier-free parts of northern America would have been arctic during much of this period, providing few game animals for the migrants to hunt
and very little wood with which they could make fires. But for a brief period
around 12,000 years ago the Beringian land bridge was open at a time when
the climate was warming and the glaciers were receding, such that there was
an ice-free corridor leading from Beringia to central North America (Figure
19.31). These considerations, together with the absence of archaeological evidence of humans in North America before 11,500 years ago, led to the adoption of “about 12,000 years ago” as the date for the first entry of humans into
the New World. Recent evidence for human occupation before 11,500 years
ago has prompted some rethinking, but it is still generally assumed that a
substantial population migration into North America, from which all modern
Native Americans are descended, occurred about 12,000 years ago.
What information does molecular phylogenetics provide? The first relevant
studies were carried out in the late 1980s using mitochondrial RFLP data.
These indicated that Native Americans are descended from Asian ancestors
and identified four distinct mitochondrial haplogroups, called A, B, C, and D,
among the population as a whole. Linguistic studies had already shown that
American languages can be divided into three different groupings, suggesting
that modern Native Americans are descended from three sets of people, each
speaking a different language. The inference from the molecular data that
there may in fact have been four ancestral populations was not too disquieting. The first significant dataset of mitochondrial DNA sequences was
obtained in 1991, enabling the rigorous application of a molecular clock. This
indicated that the migrations into North America occurred between 15,000
and 8000 years ago, which is consistent with the archaeological evidence that
humans were absent from the continent before 11,500 years ago.
These early phylogenetic analyses confirmed, or at least were not too discordant with, the complementary evidence provided by archaeological and linguistic studies. However, the additional molecular data that have been
acquired since 1992 have tended to confuse rather than clarify the issue. For
example, different datasets have provided a variety of estimates for the number of migrations into North America. One particularly comprehensive analysis, based on mitochondrial DNA, put the figure at just one migration, and

migration of humans into the New
World. For a short period some 12,000
years ago, the Beringian land bridge was
open at the same time as the ice-free
corridor into central North America. The
dark green areas show regions that were
exposed land at that time but are currently

suggested that it occurred between 25,000 and 20,000 years ago, much earlier
than the traditional date for the migration period. The first studies of Y chromosomes assigned a date of approximately 22,500 years ago to the “Native
American Adam,” the carrier of the Y chromosome that is ancestral to most, if
not all, of the Y chromosomes in modern Native Americans. These results are
still being hotly debated. Some molecular anthropologists accept the implication that humans became established in North America about 20,000 years
ago, much earlier than indicated by the archaeological and previous genetic
evidence. Others believe that the genetic data as a whole are consistent with
two migrations, one 20,000 to 15,000 years ago, comprising all four haplogroups, followed by a second substantial migration at a more recent period,
involving the same haplogroups and resulting in a modification of the geographic distributions of these haplogroups in North America.

Summary
Molecular phylogenetics uses molecular information to infer the evolutionary relationships between genes and between organisms. Molecular information, such as immunological data, protein electrophoresis patterns, and
DNA–DNA hybridization data, has been used in phylogenetics for many
years, but today most comparisons are made between DNA sequences.
Groups of sequences are first aligned and polymorphisms identified. This
information is converted into numerical data, such as a distance matrix,
which can be analyzed mathematically to reconstruct a tree showing the evolutionary relationships between the sequences. There are several methods for
tree reconstruction, such as neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony,
which use different approaches to identifying the most likely tree for a particular set of data. Some of these methods are computer-intensive with a major
limitation being the vast amount of computer memory needed to make a rigorous examination of an alignment. Sometimes it is possible to apply a
molecular clock to a tree in order to assign a date to a branch point, but the
rate of the molecular clock is not the same for every organism nor even for
every part of a genome, hence care is needed to avoid errors. Some sets of
phylogenetic data, such as the sequences of members of a multigene family
which can recombine with one another, cannot be represented by a conventional tree but can be depicted as a network. Molecular phylogenetics has
resolved long-standing issues regarding the evolutionary relationships
between the primates and is providing valuable information on the evolution
of HIV and, by inference, the history of the AIDS epidemic. Molecular phylogenetics can also be applied to studies of human prehistory. By comparing
mitochondrial and Y chromosome sequences it has been deduced that all
modern humans are descended from a population that lived in Africa some
200,000 years ago, and which migrated out of Africa 100,000–50,000 years ago,
displacing the descendants of Homo erectus that were living throughout the
Old World at that time. Studies of preserved DNA from fossils have shown that
modern Europeans are not directly descended from Neandertals. The introduction of farming into Europe coincides with a relatively small-scale movement of humans from the Middle East, not a large-scale migration followed
by displacement of the indigenous hunter-gatherers as first thought. Humans
entered the New World from Asia during the last Ice Age, across a land bridge
in what is now the Bering Strait.

1.1-c; 1.3-a; 1.5-c; 1.7-c; 1.9-a; 1.11-c; 1.13-a; 1.15-b

Short Answer Questions
1.1. DNA was first discovered in 1869 (Miescher) and shown to contain genetic
information in the 1940s (Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, and Hershey and
Chase). The structure of the double helix was determined in 1953 (Watson
and Crick) and the first complete genome sequence for a cellular organism
was completed in 1995.
1.3. The limitation that A can only base-pair with T, and G can only base-pair
with C, means that DNA replication can result in perfect copies of a parent
molecule through the simple expedient of using the sequences of the preexisting strands to dictate the sequences of the new strands. Base pairing
therefore enables DNA molecules to be replicated into perfect copies.
1.5. Bacterial mRNAs have half-lives of no more than a few minutes and in
eukaryotes most mRNAs are degraded a few hours after synthesis. This rapid
turnover means that the composition of the transcriptome is not fixed and
can quickly be restructured by changing the rate of synthesis of individual
mRNAs. The composition of the transcriptome can therefore be rapidly adjusted in accordance with the needs of the cell.
1.7. Every cell receives part of its parent’s transcriptome when it is first
brought into existence by cell division, and maintains a transcriptome
throughout its lifetime. Transcription of individual protein-coding genes
does not therefore result in synthesis of the transcriptome but instead maintains the transcriptome by replacing mRNAs that have been degraded, and
brings about changes to the composition of the transcriptome via the switching on and off of different sets of genes.

1.9. Proteins are structurally and functionally diverse because the amino
acids from which they are made are chemically diverse. Different sequences
of amino acids therefore result in different combinations of chemical reactivities, these combinations dictating not only the overall structure of the resulting protein but also the positioning on the surface of the structure of reactive
groups that determine the chemical properties of the protein.
1.11. The location of the codon is important in determining whether it functions as a stop codon or specifies selenocysteine. There is a hairpin loop
structure just downstream of the selenocysteine codon that allows this amino
acid to be incorporated into the growing polypeptide chain.

In-depth Problems
1.1. The justification for this statement can be found in The Double Helix by
James Watson or in most of the various books written about the history of
DNA, such as The Eighth Day of Creation by Horace Freeland Judson (see
Further Reading). It was during the evening of Saturday 7 March 1953 that
Watson and Crick completed their model of the double helix structure, made
out of thin pieces of galvanized metal and brass rods, with a scale of 50 cm per
nm, a complete turn of the model helix being almost 2 m. It could be argued,
however, that the actual discovery was made one week earlier when Watson
and Crick realized that the hydrogen-bonded structures formed by A with T
and G with C have the same outline shapes (see Figure 1.8B), enabling these
base pairs to be stacked to form a regular helix of unvarying width. Crick
recalls that this discovery came when they realized the significance of
Chargaff’s base ratios, but Watson maintains that this significance was appreciated only after they had built their first models of the nucleotide pairs.
1.3. The elucidation of the genetic code was the most important breakthrough
in biology in the 1960s, and although this work was carried out almost half a
century ago it is still an excellent example of the scientific method—how to
plan a research strategy toward a defined end, and how to modify that strategy to utilize new techniques that are developed during the course of a project. Books such as The Eighth Day of Creation (see Further Reading) give a
detailed account of how the code was cracked, but the best starting points for
a tutorial discussion of this subject are the three reviews in Scientific American
that were written during and at the end of the project. These are Crick, F.H.C.
(1962) The genetic code. Sci. Am. 207(4): 66–74; Nirenberg, M.W. (1963) The
genetic code II. Sci. Am. 208(3): 80–94; and Crick, F.H.C. (1966) The genetic
code III. Sci Am. 215(4): 55–62.

1.1. Part A shows that treatment of the transforming principle with protease
or ribonuclease has no effect, but that the transforming principle is inactivated by deoxyribonuclease. The transforming principle, which contains the
genetic information needed to convert the harmless bacteria into the virulent
form, must therefore be made of DNA. Part B shows that when bacteriophages are labeled with 32P and 35S, most of the 32P-labeled material (the
DNA) but only 20% of the 35S-labeled material (the phage protein) enters the
cells during infection. As the bacteriophage genes must enter the bacteria to
direct synthesis of new bacteriophages, these genes must be made of DNA.
1.3. The model shows that the sugar–phosphate backbone is on the outside
of the molecule and that the bases are present on the inside. The bases are
clearly exposed in the major and minor grooves where they can be recognized
by DNA-binding proteins.

Short Answer Questions
2.1. A gene is cloned when the DNA fragment containing it is inserted into a
vector DNA molecule (such as a plasmid or bacteriophage) and then replicated in a host cell.
2.3. One can attach linker or adapter molecules to the ends of the bluntended molecules to generate sticky ends that facilitate ligation.
2.5. This allows for easy selection of bacterial cells that have been transformed with the plasmid.
2.7. The bacteriophage genome contains genes for the lysogenic infection of
E. coli that are not essential and can be replaced with new DNA. The bacteriophage can be used to close DNA molecules up to 18 kb in length.
2.9. These require the presence of a centromere, telomeres, and at least one
origin of replication.
2.11. The primers hybridize to specific sequences in the template DNA and
define the regions to be amplified.

In-depth Problems
2.1. The moratorium arose from the Asilomar Conference in 1975, and was
proposed by Paul Berg and others in Berg, P., Baltimore, D., Brenner, S., Roblin,
R.O. and Singer, M.F. (1975) Summary statement of the Asilomar Conference
on recombinant DNA molecules. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 72: 1981–1984. A
less specialist account of the background to the moratorium can be found in
Cherfas, J. (1982) Man Made Life. Blackwell Scientific Publishers, Oxford. It is
tempting to conclude that because the fears of these scientists have never
become reality then those fears were unjustified, but a full debate of this issue
must also take account of the outcomes of the moratorium (e.g. the development of strategies for preventing the survival of genetically engineered bacteria in the natural environment) which have been greatly instrumental in
ensuring that the dangers that prompted the moratorium have been avoided.
2.3. This question looks ahead to the discussion of restriction mapping in
Section 3.3.1. Attempting to “invent” restriction mapping in a class discussion
is an excellent way of ensuring that the principles of restriction, gel electrophoresis, and such like have been grasped.
2.5. Assuming the target sequence for the PCR is single copy in the genome
being studied, then the important issue is the length of the primers. If the
primers are too short they might hybridize to nontarget sites and give undesired amplification products. The best way to illustrate this point is to imagine that total human DNA is used in a PCR experiment with a pair of primers
eight nucleotides in length. The likely result is that a number of different fragments will be amplified. This is because attachment sites for these primers
are expected to occur, on average, once every 48 = 65,536 bp, giving approximately 49,000 possible sites in the 3,200,000 kb of nucleotide sequence that
makes up the human genome. This means that it would be very unlikely that
a pair of eight-nucleotide primers would give a single, specific amplification
product with human DNA as there would be several positions where annealing sites would, by chance, lie close enough together to give an amplification
product. In contrast, the expected frequency of a 17-nucleotide sequence is
once every 417 = 17,179,869,184 bp. This figure is over five times greater than

629

Genomes 3 Appendix

Appendix

the length of the human genome, so a pair of 17-nucleotide primers should
therefore give a single, specific amplification product. The ideal annealing
temperature must be low enough to enable hybridization between primer
and template, but high enough to prevent mismatched hybrids from forming.
The information needed to understand how to determine the appropriate
temperature for a pair of primers is given in the legend to Figure 3.8. For a
more detailed discussion, see Brown, T.A. (2006) Gene Cloning and DNA

for the nucleotide addition. The primer can also be used to specify the location
of DNA synthesis on the template molecules (as in DNA sequencing and PCR).

3.1-d; 3.3-a; 3.5-d; 3.7-c; 3.9-b; 3.11-c; 3.13-a; 3.15-d

Short Answer Questions
3.1. A genome map provides a guide for the sequencing experiments by
showing the positions of genes and other distinctive features. If a map is
unavailable then it is likely that errors will be made in assembling the genome
sequence, especially in regions that contain repetitive DNA.
3.3. The primers for the PCR are designed so that they anneal either side of
the polymorphic site, and the RFLP is typed by treating the amplified fragment with the restriction enzyme and then running a sample in an agarose
gel. Before the invention of PCR, RFLPs were typed by Southern hybridization, which is time-consuming.
3.5. If a pair of genes display linkage then they must be on the same chromosome. If crossing-over is a random event then the recombination frequency
between a pair of linked genes is a measure of their distance apart on the
chromosome. The recombination frequencies for different pairs of genes can
be used to construct a map of their relative positions on the chromosome.
3.7. The double homozygote will produce gametes that are all the same
genetically and if they are recessive then this parent will not contribute to the
phenotype of the offspring.
3.9. FISH uses a fluorescently labeled DNA fragment as a probe to bind to an
intact chromosome. The binding position can be determined and this information used to create a physical map of the chromosome.
3.11. Individual chromosomes can be separated by flow cytometry. Dividing
cells are carefully broken open so that a mixture of intact chromosomes is
obtained. The chromosomes are then stained with a fluorescent dye. The
amount of dye that a chromosome binds depends on its size, so larger chromosomes bind more dye and fluoresce more brightly than smaller ones. The chromosome preparation is diluted and passed through a fine aperture, producing a
stream of droplets, each one containing a single chromosome. The droplets pass
through a detector that measures the amount of fluorescence, and hence identifies which droplets contain the particular chromosome being sought. An electric charge is applied to these drops, and no others, enabling the droplets containing the desired chromosome to be deflected and separated from the rest.

In-depth Problems
3.1. The text indicates that the ideal features include high frequency in the
genome being studied, ease of typing, and the presence of multiple alleles.
This implies that SSLPs should be the “ideal” markers, but in reality SNPs are
more popular. A discussion of this apparent paradox demands consideration
of the relative importance of each of the three criteria, and in particular a realization that the critical feature of an “ideal” marker is high density.
3.3. Many teachers will remember tackling this question during their own student days, and the answer has not changed: short generation time, large
number of offspring, easily scored phenotypes, and such like. It is instructive
to consider to what extent genomics has added new criteria to this list: is a
complete genome sequence a useful feature of an organism to be used in
studies of heredity?
3.5. This is a very open-ended question that is designed to prompt discussion
of a number of topics that are covered in later chapters. The discussion might
begin by asking what purpose the map is intended to fulfill. A map designed
to aid a sequencing project might not be the same as one designed to enable
individual genes to be cloned. If it is concluded that for sequencing purposes
a physical map is more useful, and in fact a genetic map has little or no direct
value (which is a reasonable inference to make from a reading of Chapter 4),
then the discussion could turn to how easy or otherwise it would be to locate
the genes in a genome sequence, and to assign functions to those genes,
without any prior knowledge of where the genes are. These issues are discussed in Chapter 5.

Figure Tests
3.1. When the oligonucleotide is not hybridized to the target sequence, the
fluorescent label and quenching molecule are next to each other and the fluorescence is quenched. When the oligonucleotide binds to a target sequence,
the fluorescent label is located away from the quenching molecule. By controlling the hybridization conditions, the oligonucleotide will only bind to the
target sequence if all the nucleotides are complementary.
3.3. This is orthogonal field alternation gel electrophoresis, in which the electric
field alternates between the pairs of electrodes. The DNA molecules move down
through the gel, but each change in the field forces the molecules to realign.
Shorter molecules realign more quickly than longer ones and so migrate more
rapidly through the gel. The overall result is that molecules much longer than
those separated by conventional gel electrophoresis can be resolved.

Short Answer Questions
4.1. The dideoxynucleotides lack a 3¢–hydroxyl group, and when dideoxynucleotides are incorporated into the DNA, strand synthesis stops.
4.3. Yes, this is possible. The PCR product is purified and thermal cycle
sequencing performed with one of the PCR primers used as the primer for the
sequencing reactions.
4.5. Automated sequencers with multiple capillaries working in parallel can
read up to 96 different sequences in a 2-hour period, which means that with

Appendix

an average of 750 bp per individual experiment, 864 kb of information can be
generated per machine per day. This enables data needed to sequence an
entire genome to be generated in a period of weeks.
4.7. The redundancy is required as the clones for the sequencing project are
randomly generated and sequenced; thus, to ensure complete coverage of the
genome it is necessary to sequence a large number of nucleotides.
4.9. Clone fingerprinting can be based on restriction enzyme patterns, repetitive DNA fingerprints, repetitive DNA PCR, and STS content mapping.
4.11. Shotgun sequencing of complex eukaryotic genomes can result in segments of DNA, possibly including genes or parts of genes, being omitted from
the draft sequence. There is also a greater chance that sequence errors will
not be recognized.

In-depth Problems
4.1. The text at the start of Section 4.1 states that “chain termination sequencing has gained preeminence for several reasons, not least being the relative
ease with which the technique can be automated,” and this is the major part
of the answer to this question. A consideration of why the chemical degradation technique has proven intractable to automation is a good way of raising
awareness of the problems inherent in the development of automated technology. A second drawback of the chemical degradation method is the toxicity of the chemicals that are used, toxicity being an unavoidable property of
any compound that is able to bind and modify DNA molecules. Although not
an academic point, this question can therefore be used to introduce risk and
safety aspects of laboratory molecular biology.
4.3. Section 4.2.2 covers the clone contig approach, but a critical evaluation is
more usefully based on a comparison between the clone contig and wholegenome shotgun approaches, in particular as these have been applied to the
human genome. From this comparison it becomes obvious that a rigorous
clone contig project is relatively time-consuming, but that it is currently the
only way to ensure an error rate of less than one in 104 nucleotides, the figure
set as the acceptable maximum for a “finished” sequence.
4.5. The central issue is the tension between the company’s right to protect its
investment, which is accepted without question in most other aspects of
commercial activity, and the less-well-defined rights of the individual(s)
whose genes were used by the company during the research that led to development of the drug. A variety of views are possible, and a professional and
reasonable justification of the view expressed is the most important part of
the answer to this question.

Figure Tests
4.1. For most sequencing experiments a universal primer is used, this being
one that is complementary to the part of the vector DNA immediately adjacent to the point into which new DNA is ligated. The same universal primer
can therefore give the sequence of any piece of DNA that has been ligated into
the vector. It is possible to extend the sequence in one direction by synthesizing an internal primer, designed to anneal at a position within the insert
DNA. An experiment with this primer will provide a second short sequence
that overlaps the previous one.
4.3. This is chemical degradation sequencing and it is useful when there are
problems with standard, chain termination sequencing reactions (due to
blockage of DNA polymerase or altered migration of sequencing products
during electrophoresis).

Chapter 5: Understanding a Genome Sequence
Multiple Choice Questions
5.1-b; 5.3-b; 5.5-a; 5.7-b; 5.9-b; 5.11-d; 5.13-b

Short Answer Questions
5.1. Computers can readily scan all six reading frames of a DNA sequence for
ORFs. In addition, as a random DNA sequence would possess a stop codon at
least every 100–200 bp and most genes contain more than this number of
codons, it is fairly straightforward to identify coding sequences in bacterial
genomes that lack introns and other significant noncoding sequences.
5.3. Computer programs can be modified to screen for codon bias, exon–
intron boundaries, and upstream regulatory sequences of genes.
5.5. Some genes contain optional exons and may encode different-sized
mRNA molecules. Also, it is possible that not all of the genes present in a DNA
fragment will be expressed in the cells from which the RNA is isolated.
5.7. Orthologous genes are homologous genes present in different organisms
and paralogous genes are homologous genes present in the same organism.
5.9. If the biochemical activity of the gene product is known in another
species, it may provide clues to the function of the gene in humans. Other
organisms can also be used in experimental analyses to study gene function.
5.11. Comparative genomics, identifying expressed sequences, and transposon tagging can be used to determine if short ORFs are genuine genes.

In-depth Problems
5.1. This is a difficult question but a consideration of the basic principles
enables progress to be made. Section 5.1.1 makes it clear that identifying
exon–intron boundaries is the major hindrance to eukaryotic gene location by
sequence inspection. It is probably reasonable to conclude that the consensus
sequences currently assigned to these sites are as accurate as they can be, as
they are based on comparisons between many exon–intron boundaries in
many organisms. Hence it could be argued that sequence inspection on its
own will never be a means of identifying a gene sequence with certainty. The
discussion must therefore center on the potential of homology searching, both
for gene location and assignment of function. The key issues are probably the
extent to which homology searching will become more powerful and more
accurate as a greater number of sequences are added to the databases, and
whether the potential of comparative genomics, as used with Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and related yeasts, can be realized with other organisms. To address
the second point, consider how closely related two genomes need to be for
comparative genomics to be useful, and whether it is likely that pairs or groups
of genomes with the required degree of relatedness will become available
among, for example, mammals, in the foreseeable future.
5.3. The sequence is from the human myoglobin protein. The other sequences
identified by the BLAST search are orthologs of the human protein.

Figure Tests
5.1. The computer program would search for the exon–intron boundary and
identify the intron sequence.
5.3. Most of the regulatory signals that control gene expression are contained in
the region of DNA upstream of the ORF, so the GFP gene will now display the
same expression pattern as the test gene. The expression pattern of this gene can
therefore be determined by examining the organism for the presence of GFP.

Chapter 6: Understanding How a Genome
Functions
Multiple Choice Questions
6.1-b; 6.3-c; 6.5-a; 6.7-b; 6.9-a; 6.11-c; 6.13-b

Short Answer Questions
6.1. To understand how the genome as a whole operates within the cell, specifying and coordinating the various biochemical activities that take place.
These global studies of genome activity must address not only the genome
itself but also the transcriptome and proteome.
6.3. If two different mRNAs have similar sequences then they may crosshybridize to each other’s specific probe on the array. This often happens
when two or more paralogous genes are active in the same tissue. The transcriptome then contains a group of related mRNAs, each of which is able to
hybridize to some extent with different members of the gene family.
Distinguishing the relative amounts of each mRNA, or even being certain
which particular mRNAs are present, can then be difficult. To solve this problem it is necessary to design a DNA chip that carries oligonucleotides that are
specific for the particular sequences that are unique to each member of a
family of paralogs.
6.5. Genes that display similar expression profiles are likely to be ones with
related functions. These can be identified by hierarchical clustering, which
involves comparing the expression levels of every pair of genes in every transcriptome that has been analysed, and assigning a value that indicates the
degree of relatedness between those genes. These data can be expressed as a
dendrogram, in which genes with related expression profiles are clustered
together. The dendrogram gives a clear visual indication of the functional
relationships between genes.
6.7. Examination of the transcriptome gives an accurate indication of which
genes are active in a particular cell, but gives a less accurate indication of the
proteins that are present. This is because the factors that influence protein
content include not only the amount of mRNA that is available, but also the
rate at which the mRNAs are translated into protein and the rate at which the
proteins are degraded.
6.9. The cloning vector used in phage display is designed so that a new gene
that is cloned into it is expressed in such a way that its protein product
becomes fused with one of the phage coat proteins. The phage protein therefore carries the foreign protein into the phage coat, where it is “displayed” in a
form that enables it to interact with other proteins that the phage encounters.
6.11. It is hoped that when metabolomics reaches maturity it will be possible
to use the information to design drugs that treat diseases by reversing or mitigating the particular flux abnormalities that occur in the disease state.
Metabolic profiling could also indicate any unwanted side effects of drug
treatment, enabling modifications to be made to the chemical structure of
the drug, or to its mode of use, so that these side effects are minimized.

In-depth Problems
6.1. Section 6.1.2 describes how microarrays are used to compare transcriptomes in two or more tissues or in the same tissue under different conditions,
and an exploration of the Further Reading will provide more detail and specific examples. A discussion of the difficulties in applying a cDNA sequencing
approach such as SAGE to comparisons between transcriptomes ensures that

Genomes 3 Appendix

Appendix

the key differences between the sequencing and microarray approaches are
appreciated, and emphasizes the utility of microarray technology.
6.3. The first part of the question is relatively straightforward, the text giving
one example from E. coli (the lactose permease and b-galactosidase). The second part of the question—proteins that have physical but not functional
interactions—is less easy to answer but there are examples, such as molecular chaperones (Section 13.3.1), which form physical interactions with proteins in order to assist those proteins to fold, and the proteins of the proteasome (Section 13.4), which similarly form physical interactions with proteins
being degraded. Understanding the specificity of these types of interactions
(e.g. which specific proteins are folded by which individual chaperones) is a
major goal of protein research and hence these types of interactions are
equally as interesting as those with a functional basis.
6.5. This is an open-ended question suitable for a class or small group discussion, possibly using a key paper, such as Kirschner, M.W. (2005) The meaning
of systems biology. Cell 121: 503–504, as the starting point.

Short Answer Questions
7.1. Complete digestion of human chromatin with nucleases reveals that
DNA sequences of 146 bp are protected from digestion. Partial nuclease
digestion gives rise to DNA fragments of 200 bp and multiples thereof.
7.3. Minichromosomes are shorter than macrochromosomes, but have a
much higher gene density.
7.5. Telomeres mark the ends of chromosomes and enable the cell to distinguish a real end from one caused by chromosome breakage.
7.7. A typical region of a human chromosome will have few genes (most of
which will contain introns), several repeated sequences, and a large amount of
nonrepetitive, nongenic DNA. Yeast chromosomes have higher gene densities,
with very few genes containing introns, and have few repeated sequences and
much less nongenic DNA.
7.9. Gene catalogs can be based on the known functions of genes, but such
catalogs are incomplete because in most genomes many genes have
unknown functions. Gene catalogs that are based on the identities of protein
domains coded by genes are more comprehensive as these include many
genes whose specific functions are unknown.
7.11. A conventional pseudogene has become inactivated due to mutation,
while a processed pseudogene arose by reinsertion of a cDNA copy of an
mRNA.

Appendix

In-depth Problems
7.1. This question looks forward to much of the material covered in Chapter
10—Accessing the Genome. From first principles, it should be clear that
genes that are present in regions of highly packaged chromatin are likely to be
inaccessible to the proteins responsible for activating and transcribing a
gene, and that the precise positioning of nucleosomes might also be important in determining the degree of access that there is to a gene. The text at the
end of Section 7.1.1 indicates that chemical modification of histones is
important in determining chromatin structure, and this topic can be usefully
previewed at this stage prior to detailed treatment in Chapter 10.
7.3. Figure 7.13 should be the starting point and the first objective should be
the definition of “intergenic DNA” and an appreciation that this excludes all
the sequences contained within genes (coding regions and introns), related
to genes (e.g., pseudogenes, gene fragments), or required for gene activity
(e.g., the regions immediately upstream of genes). Traditionally, however,
intergenic DNA includes some functional sequences such as origins of replication (Section 15.2.1) and sequences that attach chromosomes to the
nuclear substructure (Section 10.1.2). Once this fact has been recognized, the
next question is whether any of the substantial repetitive component has a
function. From Section 7.1.2 it should be clear that at least some of the satellite and minisatellite DNA is functional, and the last paragraph of Chapter 7
indicates that much of the interspersed repetitive DNA has transpositional
activity, but to what extent can this be considered a “function”?

Figure Tests
7.1. The figure shows part of the human karyogram. The chromosomes are
distinguished by their size, the location of the centromere, and the banding
patterns present after staining.
7.3. The figure shows a processed pseudogene, which is not functional
because it is derived from an mRNA, and hence lacks the nucleotide sequences needed to switch on and regulate gene expression.

Multiple Choice Questions
8.1-d; 8.3-a; 8.5-c; 8.7-a; 8.9-c; 8.11-d; 8.13-c

Short Answer Questions
8.1. Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear and have histone proteins that are
involved in packaging the DNA. Eukaryotic chromosomes have multiple
origins of replication and contain centromeres and telomeres. The E. coli
chromosome is a circular molecule that contains a single origin of replication, is packaged by supercoiling, and lacks centromeres and telomeres.
8.3. HU proteins are structually different from histones, but like histones
form tetramers around which the DNA is wound.
8.5. Prokaryotic genomes are very gene dense, contain very short regions of
intergenic DNA, and lack introns and repetitive DNA sequences.
8.7. Because it is parasitic many of the nutritional needs of this bacterium are
provided by its host and its genome therefore lacks many genes coding for
proteins involved in biosynthetic pathways.

8.9. Because DNA can be exchanged between different species through lateral gene transfer.

In-depth Problems
8.1. The text in Section 8.1.1 strongly suggests that the traditional view of the
prokaryotic genome as a single, circular DNA molecule should indeed be
abandoned. A discussion of what definition should be adopted will probably
not reach a firm conclusion (as no such conclusion has yet been reached by
microbial geneticists), but the exercise is instructive in that it requires a clear
distinction to be made between plasmids and genomes.
8.3. Section 8.2.3 suggests that the answer to this question is “no,” and the discussion should cover the main points addressed in this Section: the general
difficulty in applying species concepts devised for eukaryotes to prokaryotes;
the substantial differences that genome sequencing has revealed between the
gene contents of strains traditionally regarded as members of a single species;
and the complications presented by lateral gene transfer.

Figure Tests
8.1. The E. coli chromosome is attached to a protein core from which supercoiled DNA loops extend. If a DNA break occurs in one loop, then only that
loop loses its supercoiling.
8.3. The genes in this figure are present in an operon and hence will be transcribed into a single mRNA molecule.

Short Answer Questions
9.1. Viruses are obligate parasites dependent on host cells for reproduction.
Viruses lack many of the components essential for the viability of cellular
organisms; all viruses use their host’s ribosomes, and not all viruses have
genes for DNA or RNA polymerases.
9.3. These are genes that share nucleotide sequences, but code for different
proteins. The nucleotide sequences of overlapping genes are translated in different reading frames.
9.5. Only bacteriophages have capsids of the head-and-tail type. Eukaryotic
viruses, especially those that infect animals, may be covered with a lipid
membrane.
9.7. A transposon is a segment of DNA that can move from one position to
another within a genome.
9.9. The long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) make up over 20% of the
human genome and a full-length element contains two genes, one of which
codes for reverse transcriptase. The short interspersed nuclear elements
(SINEs) have the highest copy number of any sequence within the human
genome and lack genes. To transpose they must make use of reverse transcriptases synthesized from LINEs.
9.11. Active DNA transposons are more common in plant genomes than in
the human genome. Some plant transposons work together, as is seen with

the Ac/Ds family discovered by Barbara McClintock. The Ac element codes
for a transposase that recognizes both Ac and Ds sequences.

In-depth Problems
9.1. A traditional question and one for which little guidance can be provided.
The key to a productive discussion is not to get bogged down in a consideration of viruses, but to identify a meaningful definition of “life,” and then to
decide if this definition encompasses noncellular systems.
9.3. Selfish DNA is looked on as DNA that confers no benefit on a genome but
is tolerated because there is no selective pressure to get rid of it. If this view is
correct then possession of transposons is neither an advantage nor a disadvantage and so these elements are simply propagated along with the functional parts of the genome. See Orgel, L.E. and Crick, F.H.C. (1980) Selfish
DNA: the ultimate parasite. Nature 284: 604–607. Note that an argument
against the benign nature of transposons is provided by the attempts that
some organisms make to limit their activity, notably by methylating and
hence inactivating these sequences (Section 17.3.3).
9.5. This question is answered in Section 17.3.2 when we consider the transposition process for an LTR retroelement and discover that replication of the
element involves two switches, each from one LTR to the other, these
switches ensuring that the complete sequence of the retroelement is copied
(see Figure 17.18).

9.3. Retrovirus infection.
9.5. The Ac and Ds elements were first characterized by Barbara McClintock.
The Ac elements possess a transposase gene which is lacking in the Ds elements. The transposase encoded by the Ac elements is responsible for the
transposition of both the Ac and Ds elements.

Short Answer Questions
10.1. Electron microscopy of cells prepared by treatment with DNase, to
degrade the DNA, and salt extraction, to remove the histone proteins, has
revealed the nuclear matrix—a complex network of protein and RNA fibrils.
Fluorescent labeling of specific proteins has shown that activities such as
RNA splicing are localized into distinct regions of the nucleus.
10.3. This suggests that these pairs of chromosomes occupy adjacent territories within the nucleus.
10.5. The positional effect refers to the variability in gene expression that
occurs when a gene has been cloned in an eukaryotic host. It is due to the
random nature of the insertion, which could place the gene into a region of
open or highly packaged chromatin.
10.7. Insulators and LCRs can both overcome the positional effect when
linked to genes inserted into eukaryotic cells. LCRs also stimulate expression
of genes that are present within their functional domains; insulators are
unable to do this.

proteins.
10.11. DNase I cannot cleave DNA that is inaccessible, for example because it
is contained in highly packaged chromatin. Sites that are susceptible to DNase
I cleavage are usually adjacent to genes that are being expressed.

In-depth Problems
10.1. A consideration of the procedures used to prepare cells for electron
microscopy usually leads to the conclusion that structures present in living
nuclei are likely to be lost and that artifacts that do not exist in living nuclei
might be created. The counter argument is the general concordance between
the view of the inside of the nucleus as developed by electron microscopy and
the interpretations arising from the more recent and less destructive methods
based on confocal microscopy.
10.3. Starting points are Strahl, B.D. and Allis, C.D. (2000) The language of
covalent histone modifications. Nature 403: 41–45; and Jenuwein, T. and Allis,
C.D. (2001) Translating the histone code. Science 293: 1074–1080.

research literature, such as Lee, J.T. (2005) Regulation of X-chromosome
counting by Tsix and Xite sequences. Science 309: 768–771.

Short Answer Questions
11.1. The homeodomain is an extended helix-turn-helix motif made up of 60
amino acids which form four a-helices, numbers 2 and 3 separated by a
b-turn, with number 3 acting as the recognition helix and number 1 making
contacts within the minor groove.
11.3. In one type of modification assay, the DNA is treated with a nuclease,
which cleaves all phosphodiester bonds except those protected by the bound
protein. In the second type of assay the DNA is treated with a methylating agent.
Those nucleotides protected by the bound protein will not be methylated.
11.5. Within the major groove, hydrogen bonds form between the nucleotide
bases and the R groups of amino acids in the recognition structure of the protein, whereas in the minor groove hydrophobic interactions are more important. On the surface of the helix, the major interactions are electrostatic,
between the negative charges on the phosphate component of each
nucleotide and the positive charges on the R groups of amino acids such as
lysine and arginine, although some hydrogen bonding also occurs.
11.7. The core promoter is the site where the transcription initiation complex
is assembled. The upstream promoter elements are the attachment sites for

DNA-binding proteins that regulate assembly of the initiation complex.
11.9. The lactose repressor binds to the operator sequence of the lactose
operon to prevent transcription. When lactose is present, its isomer allolactose binds to the repressor. When allolactose is bound, the structure of the
repressor changes so that it can no longer bind to the operator.
11.11. The presence of alternative or multiple promoters enables two or more
transcripts to be specified by a single gene. This results in a similar but not

fragments representing entire chromosome sequences, followed by application of purified binding protein or nuclear extracts, with binding detected by
treatment of the microarray with a labeled antibody specific for the binding
protein.
11.3. The answer to the first part of the question can be obtained from
Sections 11.3.1 and 11.3.2 but the justification requires some additional
thought. At the end of Section 11.3.1 there is a series of bullet points listing
the principles of bacterial gene regulation and the text states that these principles apply also to eukaryotes. This is true and undoubtedly recognition of
these principles has aided the development of our understanding of gene regulation in eukaryotes. However, consider also the possibility that transferring
these principles from prokaryotes to eukaryotes might be unhelpful in that it
could result in the importance of certain aspects of the regulation of transcription initiation in eukaryotes being unappreciated because no equivalent
processes occur in bacteria.
11.5. Consider, as advantages of the module concept: the clear picture that
emerges of the regulatory scenario to which a gene is subject; the distinction
between modules of different types, again providing clarity; and the fact that
these modules clearly exist. Consider, as disadvantages: the emphasis placed
on DNA sequences when it is the binding proteins that are the actual regulators; the possibility that cooperativity between binding proteins is obscured;
and the emphasis placed on the region immediately upstream of a gene,
whereas important regulatory signals might be located at distant sites. Of
these issues, the most important is perhaps the emphasis that the modular
system places on the DNA. Not only is this misleading—the binding proteins
being the active players in gene regulation—but it obscures the role of chromatin modification in gene regulation.

Figure Tests
11.1. The 434 repressor contains a helix-turn-helix motif. The second helix of
the motif fits into the major groove of DNA and the amino acid side chains
make specific contacts with the bases.
11.3. In both the major and minor grooves the chemical features are asymmetric and the orientation of the A–T pair can be identified by a binding
protein.
11.5. The E. coli RNA polymerase recognizes the –35 box as its binding
sequence. After attachment to the DNA, the transition from closed to open
complex is initiated by breakage of base pairs in the AT-rich –10 box.

Chapter 12: Synthesis and Processing of RNA
Multiple Choice Questions
12.1-a; 12.3-a; 12.5-c; 12.7-b; 12.9-d; 12.11-c; 12.13-c; 12.15-c

Short Answer Questions
12.1. Rho attaches to the transcript and moves along the RNA towards the
polymerase. If the polymerase continues to synthesize RNA then it keeps
ahead of the pursuing Rho, but at the termination signal the polymerase stalls
and Rho is able to catch up. Rho is a helicase, which means that it actively
breaks base pairs, in this case between the template and transcript, resulting
in termination of transcription.
12.3. Attenuation works by coupling transcription and translation and these
processes are not coupled in eukaryotic organisms as RNA is transcribed in
the nucleus and translation occurs in the cytoplasm.
12.5. The tRNA sequence within the precursor molecule adopts its basepaired cloverleaf structure and two additional hairpin structures form, one on
either side of the tRNA. Processing begins with a cut by ribonuclease E or F
forming a new 3¢ end just upstream of one of the hairpins. Ribonuclease D,
which is an exonuclease, trims seven nucleotides from this new 3¢ end and
then pauses while ribonuclease P makes a cut at the start of the cloverleaf,
forming the 5¢ end of the mature mRNA. Ribonuclease D then removes two
more nucleotides, creating the 3¢ end of the mature molecule. All mature
tRNAs must end with the trinucleotide 5¢–CCA–3¢. With some pre-tRNAs this
sequence is absent, or is removed by the processing ribonucleases. This
occurs with most of those pre-tRNAs whose 3¢ ends are created by an endonuclease called ribonuclease Z, which makes a cut adjacent to the first base pair
in the tRNA cloverleaf and hence removes the region that would contain the
terminal CCA. When the CCA is absent, it is added one or more templateindependent RNA polymerases such as tRNA nucleotidyltransferase.
12.7. Bacterial mRNA degradation begins with removal of the 3¢ terminal
region, including the hairpin, by an endonuclease, either RNase E or
RNase III, exposing a new end from which the exonucleases RNase II and
PNPase can degrade the remainder of the molecule.
12.9. The first step in capping is addition of an extra guanosine to the extreme
5¢ end of the RNA. The g-phosphate of the terminal nucleotide is removed, as
are the b and g phosphates of the GTP, resulting in a 5¢–5¢ bond. The reaction
is carried out by the enzyme guanylyl transferase. The second step of the capping reaction converts the new terminal guanosine into 7-methylguanosine
by attachment of a methyl group to nitrogen number 7 of the purine ring, this
modification catalyzed by guanine methyltransferase.
12.11. The snoRNAs base-pair to the pre-rRNA to identify the residues to be
methylated or pseudouridinylated. For residues to be methylated, the base
pairing occurs upstream of a D box.

In-depth Problems
12.1. This view is most eloquently described by von Hippel, P.H. (1998) An
integrated model of the transcription complex in elongation, termination,
and editing. Science 281: 660–665, which should be used as the starting point
of an evaluation of this interpretation of transcription.
12.3. This question looks forward to the discussion of the origins of introns in
Section 18.3.2. The “introns late” hypothesis postulates that introns evolved
relatively recently and are gradually accumulating in eukaryotic genomes.

641

Appendix

According to this model, introns are absent in bacteria because the basic bacterial genome plan became established before the first introns appeared. In
contrast, the “introns early” hypothesis states that introns are very ancient
and are gradually being lost from eukaryotic genomes. The absence of introns
in bacterial genomes is therefore a stumbling block for proponents of the
“introns early” hypothesis but, as described in Section 18.3.2, there are ways
around this problem.
12.5. The RNA world within which ribozymes were the only type of biological
catalyst is described in Section 18.1.1. Why some ribozymes have persisted is
unknown, but note that most of the functions of ribozymes described in
Table 12.4 involve sequence-specific cleavage of RNA molecules. Recall that
Technical Note 5.1 states that “the only major deficiency in the RNA toolkit is
the absence of enzymes with the degree of sequence specificity displayed by
the restriction endonucleases that are so important in DNA manipulations.”

Figure Tests
12.1. An RNA hairpin is formed when the inverted palindrome of the terminator sequence is transcribed. The hairpin formation is favored over the
DNA–RNA base pairing and results in fewer DNA–RNA contacts. When the
A-rich sequence of the template is transcribed, there are several A–U base
pairs that have only two hydrogen bonds each. These two factors weaken the
interaction between the template and transcript and cause termination.
12.3. Cleavage of the 5¢ splice site occurs by a transesterification reaction promoted by the hydroxyl group attached to the 2¢ carbon of the adenosine
nucleotide located within the intron sequence. The result of the hydroxyl
attack is cleavage of the phosphodiester bond at the 5¢ splice site, accompanied by formation of a new 5¢–2¢ phosphodiester bond linking the first
nucleotide of the intron (the G of the 5¢–GU–3¢ motif) with the internal adenosine. This means that the intron has now been looped back on itself to create
a lariat structure. Cleavage of the 3¢ splice site and joining of the exons result
from a second transesterification reaction, this one promoted by the 3¢–OH
group attached to the end of the upstream exon. This group attacks the phosphodiester bond at the 3¢ splice site, cleaving it and so releasing the intron as
the lariat structure, which is subsequently converted back to a linear RNA and
degraded. At the same time, the 3¢ end of the upstream exon joins to the newly
formed 5¢ end of the downstream exon, completing the splicing process.
12.5. The figure shows the RNA interference pathway. Double-stranded RNA
molecules are degraded to short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the enzyme
Dicer. The siRNAs attach to the mRNA, which is then cleaved by the RNA
induced silencing complex (RISC).

Short Answer Questions
13.1. Transfer RNAs form the link between the mRNA and the polypeptide
that is being synthesized. This is both a physical link, tRNAs binding to both
the mRNA and the growing polypeptide, and an informational link, tRNAs

ensuring that the polypeptide being synthesized has the amino acid
sequence that is denoted, via the genetic code, by the sequence of
nucleotides in the mRNA.
13.3. Most errors are corrected by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase itself, by an
editing process that is distinct from aminoacylation, involving different contacts with the tRNA.
13.5. The pre-initiation complex comprises the 40S subunit of the ribosome,
a “ternary complex” made up of the initiation factor eIF-2 bound to the initiator tRNAMet and a molecule of GTP, and three additional initiation factors,
eIF-1, eIF-1A, and eIF-3.
13.7. The phosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF-2 results in a repression of
translation initiation as it prevents the factor from binding the molecule of GTP
that is required for bringing the initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit.
13.9. The secondary structural motifs along the polypeptide chain form
within a few milliseconds. This step is accompanied by the protein collapsing
into a compact, but not folded, organization, with its hydrophobic groups on
the inside, shielded from water. During the next few seconds or minutes, the
secondary structural motifs interact with one another and the tertiary structure gradually takes shape, often via a series of intermediate conformations.
13.11. Inteins are capable of self-splicing so they can remove themselves
from a protein.

In-depth Problems
13.1. A good starting point for tackling this difficult problem is Ribas de
Pouplana, L. and Schimmel, P. (2001) Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases: potential
markers of genetic code development. Trends Biochem. Sci. 26: 591–596.
13.3. The evolution of the genetic code has provoked argument ever since
DNA was established as the genetic material back in the 1950s. Many
geneticists support the “frozen accident” theory, which suggests that codons
were randomly allocated to amino acids during the earliest stages of
evolution, the code subsequently becoming “frozen” because any changes
would result in widespread disruption of the amino acid sequences of
proteins, but various lines of evidence suggest that the code might have
evolved in a less random manner First, controversial experimental results
suggest that at least some amino acids bind directly to RNAs containing the
appropriate codons, this occurring in the absence of the tRNA that mediates
the interaction in present-day cells. If correct, the implication is that there is
some kind of chemical relationship between an amino acid and its codon(s).
Second, the deviations from the standard code (see Table 1.3) indicate that
the same codon reallocations have occurred more than once. If the
relationship between codon and amino acid is entirely random, as suggested
by the “frozen accident” theory, then we would not expect to see the same
codon reallocations recurring on different occasions. See also Knight, R.D.,
Freeland, S.J. and Landweber, L.F. (1999) Selection, history and chemistry: the
three faces of the genetic code. Trends Biochem. Sci. 24: 241–247; Szathmáry,
E. (1999) The origin of the genetic code: amino acids as cofactors in an RNA

Biochem. 74: 179–198.
13.5. Relevant points include the following: the early realization that
ribosomes comprise large and small subunits was critical in developing the
initial models of the mechanics of protein synthesis; identification of the P-,
A-, and E-sites was key to a more detailed understanding of translation; and

structural studies underlie the work currently being done on the peptidyl
transferase activity.

Figure Tests
13.1. An inosine residue could be present at nucleotide number 34. An
inosine at this position can base-pair with A, C, or U in the mRNA, allowing a
single tRNA molecule to recognize three different codons for an amino acid.
13.3. The CCdA-phosphate-puromycin is an analog of the transition state
that occurs during the formation of peptide bonds and is bound by the
ribosome at the peptidyl transferase active site. As no proteins are close to
the CCdA-phosphate-puromycin molecule, this indicates that the formation
of peptide bonds is not catalyzed by proteins.

Chapter 14: Regulation of Genome Activity
Multiple Choice Questions
14.1-d; 14.3-a; 14.5-a; 14.7-c; 14.9-d; 14.11-d; 14.13-c; 14.15-d

Short Answer Questions
14.1. Differentiation refers to the adoption of a specialized physiological role
by a cell. This results from permanent changes in genome expression that
alter the biochemical composition of the cell. Development is a series of
coordinated changes that occur during the life history of a cell or organism.
These changes may be temporary or permanent and must continue over a
long period of time.
14.3. When glucose is transported into E. coli, the sugar transport protein
IIAGlc becomes dephosphorylated. The dephosphorylated form of IIAGlc
inhibits the enzyme adenylate cyclase, which produces cAMP. So in the presence of glucose, cAMP levels are low; when glucose is absent, cAMP levels
are high.
14.5. MAP kinase is activated when it is phosphorylated by the Mek protein.
The phosphorylated MAP kinase moves to the nucleus where it phosphorylates
transcription activators producing a response that stimulates cell division.
14.7. Class switching results in a complete change in the type of
immunoglobulin that the lymphocyte synthesizes. This requires a recombination event that deletes the Cm and Cd sequence along with the part of the
chromosome between this region and the CH segment specifying the class of
immunoglobulin that the lymphocyte will now synthesize. For example, for
the lymphocyte to switch to synthesis of IgG, the most prevalent type of
immunoglobulin made by mature lymphocytes, then the deletion will place
one of the Cg segments, which specify the IgG heavy chain, at the 5¢ end of the
cluster. Class switching is distinct from V-D-J joining and the recombination
event does not involve the RAG proteins.
14.9. sF is activated by release from a complex with SpoIIAB. This is controlled by SpoIIAA, which, when unphosphorylated, can also attach to
SpoIIAB and prevent the latter from binding to sF. If SpoIIAA is unphosphorylated then sF is released and is active; when SpoIIAA is phosphorylated sF
remains bound to SpoIIAB and so is inactive. In the mother cell, SpoIIAB
phosphorylates SpoIIAA and so keeps sF in its bound inactive state. But in the
prespore, SpoIIAB’s attempts to phosphorylate SpoIIAA are antagonized by
yet another protein, SpoIIE, and so sF is released and becomes active.

Genomes 3 Appendix

Page 645

Appendix

SpoIIE’s ability to antagonize SpoIIAB in the prespore but not the mother cell
derives from the fact that SpoIIE molecules are bound to the membrane on
the surface of the septum. Because the prespore is much smaller than the
mother cell, but the septum surface area is similar in both, the concentration
of SpoIIE is greater in the prespore, and this enables it to antagonize SpoIIAB.
14.11. The bicoid gene is transcribed in maternal nurse cells and the mRNA is
injected into the anterior end of unfertilized eggs. The bicoid mRNA remains
in the anterior end of the egg cell, attached to the cytoskeleton by its 3¢
untranslated end. Translation of the mRNA occurs after fertilization of the egg,
and the Bicoid protein diffuses throughout the syncytium setting up a concentration gradient from the anterior end (high) to the posterior end (low).

In-depth Problems
14.1. This long essay topic requires additional reading, a good starting point
being Berg, J.M., Tymoczko, J.L. and Stryer, L. (2006) Biochemistry, 6th Ed.
W.H. Freeman, New York.
14.3. This question is most effectively approached by considering the extent
to which our current understanding of development in higher eukaryotes is
based on information which would not be available if experiments had never
been carried out with C. elegans or D. melanogaster. One opinion might be
that study of C. elegans has contributed substantially to our understanding of
the molecular basis to RNA interference (Section 12.2.6), but that this
understanding would perhaps not have been substantially delayed if C.
elegans was not available. On the other hand, it would have been difficult to
uncover the role of homeotic selector genes in higher eukaryotes (Section
14.3.4) without the prior knowledge of these genes in D. melanogaster. Other
views are possible.
14.5. Unlike the equivalent question concerning studies of heredity
(Chapter 3, In-depth Problem 3.3) there is no easy description of an ideal
model organism for higher eukaryotic development. An argument could be
constructed along the lines that the model should be the least complex
eukaryote that displays the particular developmental features under study.
Hence the ideal model is different for different aspects of development.

Figure Tests
14.1. The phenomenon is called diauxie and it results from catabolite
repression. Glucose represses expression of the lactose operon through an
indirect influence on the catabolite activator protein. This protein binds to a
recognition sequence at various sites in the bacterial genome and activates
transcription initiation at downstream promoters. Productive initiation of
transcription at these promoters is dependent on the presence of bound
catabolite activator protein: if the protein is absent then the genes controlled
by the promoter are not transcribed. Glucose does not itself interact with the
catabolite activator protein. Instead, glucose controls the level in the cell of
cAMP. It does this by inhibiting the activity of adenylate cyclase, the enzyme
that synthesizes cAMP from ATP. Inhibition is mediated by IIAGlc, a
component of a multiprotein complex that transports sugars into the
bacterium. When glucose is being transported into the cell, IIAGlc becomes
dephosphorylated. The dephosphorylated version of IIAGlc inhibits adenylate
cyclase activity. This means that if glucose levels are high, the cAMP content
of the cell is low. The catabolite activator protein can bind to its target sites
only in the presence of cAMP, so when glucose is present the protein remains
detached and the operons it controls are switched off.

14.3. During the early stage of B lymphocyte development, the immunoglobulin loci in its genome undergo rearrangements. Within the heavy-chain
locus, these rearrangements link one of the VH gene segments with one of DH
gene segments, and then link this V–D combination with a JH gene segment.
The end result is an exon that contains the complete open reading frame
specifying the V, D and J segments of the immunoglobulin protein. This exon
becomes linked to a C segment exon by splicing during the transcription
process, creating a complete heavy-chain mRNA that can be translated into
an immunoglobulin protein that is specific for just that one lymphocyte. A
similar series of DNA rearrangements results in the lymphocyte’s light-chain
V-J exon being constructed, and once again splicing attaches a C segment
exon when the mRNA is synthesized.

Chapter 15: Genome Replication
Multiple Choice Questions
15.1-c; 15.3-a; 15.5-b; 15.7-c; 15.9-b; 15.11-a; 15.13-a; 15.15-c

Short Answer Questions
15.1. The dispersive model of replication predicts that each daughter molecule will be made up partly of parental DNA and partly of newly synthesized
DNA. In semiconservative replication each daughter molecule is made up of
one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand. If replication is conservative, then one of the daughter double helices is made entirely of newly
synthesized DNA and the other comprises the two parental strands.
15.3. Rolling circle replication initiates at a nick which is made in one of the
parent polynucleotides. The free 3¢ end that results is extended, displacing the
5¢ end of the polynucleotide. Continued DNA synthesis “rolls off” a complete
copy of the genome, and further synthesis eventually results in a series of
genomes linked head to tail. These single-stranded, linear genomes are converted to double-stranded circular molecules by complementary strand synthesis, followed by cleavage at the junction points between genomes and circularization of the resulting segments.
15.5. At each end of the open, melted DNA region at the origin of replication,
a prepriming complex of DnaB and DnaC proteins assembles. DnaB is a helicase that extends the single-stranded region at the origin, allowing other
replication proteins to attach.
15.7. Primase synthesizes a primer comprising 8–12 ribonucleotides. The
strand is then extended by DNA polymerase a, which adds the next 20 or so
nucleotides (which may include some ribonucleotides). The remainder of the
leading strand copy is synthesized by DNA polymerase d.
15.9. A chromosome will become shortened if the extreme 3¢ end of the lagging
strand is not copied because the final Okazaki fragment cannot be primed, the
natural position for the priming site being beyond the end of the template. The
absence of this Okazaki fragment means that the lagging-strand copy is shorter
than it should be. If the copy remains this length then when it acts as a parent
polynucleotide in the next round of replication the resulting chromosome will
be shorter than its grandparent. Shortening, although to a lesser extent, will
also occur if the primer for the last Okazaki fragment is placed at the extreme 3¢
end of the lagging strand, because this terminal RNA primer cannot be converted into DNA by the standard processes for primer removal.

15.11. When the gene encoding Cdc6p is repressed, the prereplication complexes (pre-RCs) are absent. When the gene is overexpressed, there are multiple genome replications with no mitosis.

In-depth Problems
15.1. The reason for this acceptance is summed up in Watson and Crick’s
famous conclusion to their paper in Nature announcing the discovery of the
double helix structure of DNA: “It has not escaped our notice that the specific
pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material” (see the start of Section 15.1). Once this point
has been understood, consider the reasons why semiconservative replication
was, in fact, not immediately accepted (Section 15.1.1).
15.3. The information provided in Genomes 3 can be supplemented by the
greater amount of detail in a research review such as Patel, S.S. and Picha,
K.M. (2000) Structure and function of hexameric helicases. Annu. Rev.

telomerase in cancer. Cancer Res. 65: 3513–3517.

Figure Tests
15.1. The figure shows displacement replication. The double helix is disrupted in the D-loop by the presence of an RNA molecule base paired to one
of the DNA strands. This RNA molecule acts as the starting point for synthesis of one the daughter polynucleotides. This polynucleotide is synthesized by
continuous copying of one strand of the helix, the second strand being displaced and subsequently copied after synthesis of the first daughter genome
has been completed.
15.3. DNA polymerase III lacks a 5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease activity and so dissociates from the lagging strand when it reaches the next Okazaki fragment. Its
place is taken by DNA polymerase I, which does have a 5¢Æ3¢ exonuclease
and so removes the primer, and usually the start of the DNA component of
the Okazaki fragment, extending the 3¢ end of the adjacent fragment into the
region of the template that is exposed. The two Okazaki fragments now abut,
and the missing phosphodiester bond is put in place by a DNA ligase.

Short Answer Questions
16.1. Mutations arise via errors that occur during genome replication and
from the effects of mutagens, which are chemical or physical agents that react
with DNA and change the structure of individual nucleotides.
16.3. A DNA polymerase can discriminate against an incorrect nucleotide
when the nucleotide is first bound to the DNA polymerase, when it is moved

base to the sugar component of the nucleotide. This occurs more frequently
with purines than with pyrimidines and results in an AP (apurinic/apyrimidinic)
or baseless site. The sugar–phosphate that is left is unstable and rapidly
degrades, leaving a gap if the DNA molecule is double stranded. Approximately
10,000 AP sites are generated in each human cell per day, but these rarely lead to
mutations because cells have effective systems for repairing gaps.
16.7. The trait is dominant because a heterozygous individual is only able to
synthesize approximately 50% of the active apolipoprotein B-100 present in
the cells of an unaffected person. This reduction results in the disease state.
This is an example of haploinsufficiency.
16.9. Hypermutation is thought to result from conversion of some cytosine
bases into uracils, by a cytosine deaminase, followed by excision of the uracils
from the polynucleotide, by a uracil-DNA glycosylase, resulting in AP sites at
these positions. In base excision repair each AP site would then be filled in by
DNA polymerase b, to restore the original sequence, but in hypermutation the
AP sites are not repaired. This means that during the next round of replication
either of the four nucleotides could be placed in the daughter strand opposite
each AP site. A further round of replication then stabilizes the mutation.
16.11. In NHEJ, a multicomponent protein complex directs a DNA ligase to the
break. The complex includes Ku, which binds the DNA ends either side of the
break. Individual Ku proteins have an affinity for one another, which means
that the two broken ends of the DNA molecule are brought into proximity. Ku
binds to the DNA in association with the DNA-PKCS protein kinase, which
activates a third protein, XRCC4, which interacts with the mammalian DNA
ligase IV, directing this repair protein to the double-strand break.

In-depth Problems
16.1. A transition (a purine-to-purine or pyrimidine-to-pyrimidine change)
does not change the purine–pyrimidine orientation in the double helix. A
transversion (a purine-to-pyrimidine or pyrimidine-to-purine change)
reverses the purine–pyrimidine orientation.
16.3. As well as the papers cited in the relevant part of Further Reading, a key
review is Cummings, C.J. and Zoghbi, H.Y. (2000) Trinucleotide repeats: mechanisms and pathophysiology. Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 1: 281–328.

Heidelberg, J.F., et al. (1999) Genome sequence of the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans R1. Science 286: 1571–1577.

Figure Tests
16.1. The figure depicts the insertion of two nucleotides into a microsatellite
sequence in the DNA molecule. This is an example of replication slippage.
16.3. The enzyme DNA glycosylase removes the damaged base from the DNA.
This creates a site without a base and the sugar–phosphate group at this site
is excised by an AP endonuclease. The gap is then filled in by a DNA polymerase, and the final phosphodiester bond is put in place by DNA ligase. This
is the base excision repair pathway.

Short Answer Questions
17.1. Recombination allows for major changes and extensive restructuring of
genomes. In the absence of recombination, genomes would undergo little
change and be fairly static structures.
17.3. In the double-strand break model, homologous recombination initiates
with a double-strand break in one of the molecules. One strand in each half
of the broken chromosome is shortened, leaving 3¢ overhangs. One of the
overhangs invades the other intact DNA molecule to set up a Holliday junction. The shortened DNA strands are extended by DNA polymerase, with the
DNA synthesis in the region being converted using the DNA molecule that
did not undergo the original double-strand break as a template.
17.5. Bacteria can acquire new genes via transformation, transduction, and
conjugation. If the DNA that enters the cell is similar in sequence to part of
the E. coli genome, then homologous recombination can take place, possibly
inserting the foreign DNA into the E. coli chromosome.
17.7. The att sites each contain an identical 15 base pair core sequence. The
core sequences are flanked by variable sequences: B and B¢ (each just 4 bp in
length) in the bacterial genome, and P and P¢ in the phage DNA. P and P¢ are
both over 100 bp in length. Mutations in the core sequence inactivate the att
site so that it can also no longer participate in recombination.
17.9. The first step in replication of a retroelement is synthesis of an RNA copy.
This RNA molecule is then converted into double-stranded DNA. The first
stage in this conversion is synthesis, by reverse transcription, of a singlestranded DNA copy of the RNA molecule. This strand synthesis reaction is
primed by a tRNA that anneals to a site within the 5¢ long terminal repeat of
the RNA copy of the retroelement.

In-depth Problems
17.1. The aim of this question is to raise awareness that although the name
“RecA” indicates the role of this protein in recombination, it is more correctly
looked on as a single-strand binding protein, with additional ability to stimulate protease activity, that plays a variety of roles in bacterial molecular biology. Critical reading includes Kowalczykowski, S.C. and Eggleston, A.K. (1994)

17.5. Section 17.3.3 indicates that DNA methylation is the main process recognized for minimization of transposon activity. The extensive literature on
this subject can be difficult to unravel, but good starting points are Yoder, J.A.,

intragenomic parasites. Trends Genet. 13: 335–340; and Rabinowicz, P.D.,

Multiple Choice Questions
18.1-d; 18.3-b; 18.5-a; 18.7-d; 18.9-b; 18.11-c; 18.13-d

Short Answer Questions
18.1. The Earth’s early atmosphere contained very low levels of oxygen and
had high amounts of ammonia and methane, differing significantly from the
atmosphere of present-day Earth.
18.3. It is quite possible that more than one biological system evolved on the
ancient Earth, even though all present-day organisms appear to derive from
a single origin. The most likely scenario is that the predominant system was
the first to develop the means to synthesize protein enzymes and therefore
probably also the first to adopt a DNA genome. The greater catalytic potential
and more accurate replication conferred by protein enzymes and DNA
genomes would have given these cells a significant advantage compared with
those still containing RNA protogenomes. The DNA–RNA–protein cells would
have multiplied more rapidly, enabling them to out-compete the RNA cells
for nutrients.
18.5. One of these transitions accompanied the arrival of the first eukaryotes
about 1.4 billion years ago, these cells probably containing at least 10,000
genes (the minimum in modern eukaryotes) compared with the 5000 or fewer
typical of prokaryotes. The second transition was associated with the arrival
of the first vertebrates soon after the end of the Cambrian, these, like modern
vertebrates, probably having at least 30,000 genes.
18.7. A retrogene results from conversion of an mRNA molecule to cDNA followed by reinsertion of this cDNA back into the genome. Normally the inserted
cDNA would give rise to a pseudogene as it lacks its own promoter (and has no
introns). But if the cDNA is inserted adjacent to the promoter of an existing
gene then it could become active by subverting this promoter for own use.
18.9. Segment duplications can place exons from one gene adjacent to exons
from another gene. If the exons are then transcribed the resulting mRNA
could give rise to a novel gene product.
18.11. The “exon theory of genes” holds that introns were formed when the
first DNA genomes were constructed, soon after the end of the RNA world.
These genomes would have contained many short genes, each specifying a
very small polypeptide, perhaps just a single structural domain. To aid the
synthesis of a multidomain protein it is envisaged that groups of these short
genes were positioned next to each other. The short genes became exons and
the sequences between them became introns.

In-depth Problems
18.1. The relevant paper, as cited in Further Reading, is Vision, T.J., Brown,
D.G. and Tanksley, S.D. (2000) The origins of genomic duplications in
Arabidopsis. Science 290: 2114–2117.
18.3. The first papers to reject this proposal were Salzberg, S.L., White, O.,
Peterson, J. and Eisen, J.A. (2001). Microbial genes in the human genome: lateral transfer or gene loss? Science 292: 1903–1906; and Stanhope, M.J., Lupas,
A., Italia, M.J., Koretke, K.K., Volker, C. and Brown, J.R. (2001) Phylogenetic
analyses do not support horizontal gene transfers from bacteria to vertebrates. Nature 411: 940–944. The question looks forward to some of the
aspects of molecular phylogenetics covered in Chapter 19.

18.5. The question refers to comparisons between genome sequences. If interpreted literally then the information provided in Section 18.4 and in the
papers cited in Further Reading leads to the conclusion that the answer is
“no,” at least for comparisons between the human and chimpanzee genomes.
Might the answer be different when and if the gorilla and orangutan genomes
are sequenced? Or if a complete sequence of Neandertal DNA could be
obtained (Section 19.3.2)? If the question is interpreted less strictly and postgenomic analyses are allowed, then Section 18.4 indicates that it might be
possible to determine at least some of the factors that make us human.

Figure Tests
18.1. When there is selective pressure on just one copy of a duplicated gene
pair, the second copy can accumulate mutations that could lead to new activities or functions. Pseudogenes result from the pathway in which deleterious
mutations occur in the second copy of the gene so that this copy degrades
over time.
18.3. The top panel shows the generation of a new gene by domain duplication, as domain B is duplicated from the original gene. The bottom panel
shows domain shuffling where domains from two distinct genes combine to
form a new gene.

Chapter 19: Molecular Phylogenetics
Multiple Choice Questions
19.1-b; 19.3-a; 19.5-c; 19.7-b; 19.9-b; 19.11-c; 19.13-b

Short Answer Questions
19.1. Phenetics is a method of phylogenetic analysis that utilizes as many
variables as is possible; the prevailing view prior to the use of phenetics was
that phylogenies should be based on a limited number of characteristics that
were thought to be important.
19.3. Ancestral character states were present in the remote common ancestor
of a group of organisms whereas derived character states have evolved from
the ancestral state in a more recent common ancestor.
19.5. An internal node in a gene tree represents the divergence of the ancestral gene into two alleles via mutation. An internal node in a species tree indicates a speciation event that occurred when an ancestral group split into two
groups that could not interbreed. These mutational and speciation events are
unlikely to have occurred at the same time.
19.7. Allele frequency is affected by natural selection and random genetic
drift. Natural selection changes the frequency of alleles that impact on the fitness of an individual, while random genetic drift changes the frequency of
alleles because of the random nature of birth, death, and reproduction.
19.9. DNA was extracted from 400 mg of Neandertal bone and PCRs were
directed at what was expected to be the most variable part of the Neandertal
mitochondrial genome. It was anticipated that the DNA would be degraded,
so the sequence was built up in sections by carrying out nine overlapping
PCRs, none amplifying more than 170 bp of DNA but together giving a total
length of 377 bp. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to compare the
sequence obtained from the Neandertal bone with the sequences of six
mitochondrial DNA haplogroups from modern humans. The Neandertal

651

Genomes 3 Appendix

Appendix

sequence was positioned on a branch of its own, not linked directly to any of
the modern human sequences. A multiple alignment was made in order to
compare the Neandertal sequence with 994 sequences from modern
humans. The Neandertal sequence differed from the modern sequences at
an average of 27.2 ± 2.2 nucleotide positions whereas the modern sequences
differed from each other at only 8.0 ± 3.1 positions. The degree of difference
between Neandertal and modern European DNA is incompatible with the
notion that modern Europeans are descended from Neandertals and
strongly supports the Out of Africa hypothesis.
19.11. The first mitochondrial DNA studies indicated that Native Americans
are descended from Asian ancestors and identified four distinct mitochondrial haplogroups among the population as a whole. The migration into North
America was dated to between 15,000 and 8000 years ago. A more recent,
comprehensive analysis of mitochondrial DNA pushed this migration back to
between 25,000 and 20,000 years ago. The first studies of Y chromosomes gave
a date of approximately 22,500 years ago to the “Native American Adam”, the
carrier of the Y chromosome that is ancestral to most, if not all, of the Y chromosomes in modern Native Americans. The implications of these various
results are still being debated.

In-depth Problems
19.1. Although Figure 19.9 illustrates an example of when a gene tree is not
the same as a species tree, coincidence between the two is clearly possible.
The follow-up question is “how can you tell if a gene tree is giving an accurate
representation of a species tree?” Now the answer demands consideration of,
for example, the information summarized in Figure 19.19, which shows that
different genes or collections of genes must be studied in order to obtain a
consensus view.
19.3. Possible starting points for research into this problem are Ladoukakis,
E.D. and Zouros, E. (2001) Recombination in animal mitochondrial DNA: evidence from published sequences. Mol. Biol. Evol. 18: 2127–2131; and
Meunier, J. and Eyre-Walker, A. (2001) The correlation between linkage disequilibrium and distance: implications for recombination in hominid mitochondria. Mol. Biol. Evol. 18: 2132–2135. These are among the first papers to
raise the possibility of mitochondrial recombination, and the debate should
be followed forward by searching for later publications that cite one or both
of these papers.
19.5. A detailed introduction to this topic is given by Richards, M. (2003) The
Neolithic invasion of Europe. Annu. Rev. Anthropol. 32: 135–162. To answer
this question fully, the paper which provides the information in Figure 19.30
must be examined—Richards, M., Macaulay, V., Hickey, E., et al. (2000)
Tracing European founder lineages in the Near Eastern mtDNA pool. Am. J.
Hum. Genet. 67: 1251–1276. This is a complex paper and if you are able to
make progress with it then your study of Genomes has not been in vain.

Figure Tests
19.1. Figure (B) shows that the single toe of horses is a derived character state.
19.3. If the first speciation event is quickly followed by a second speciation
event in one of the two resulting populations, then the branching order of the
gene tree might be different from that of the species tree. This can occur if the
genes in the modern species are derived from alleles that had already
appeared before the first of the two speciation events.

Wobble hypothesis The process by which a single tRNA
can decode more than one codon.

Yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) A high-capacity
cloning vector constructed from the components of a
yeast chromosome.
Yeast two-hybrid system A technique for identifying proteins that interact with one other.
Z-DNA A conformation of DNA in which the two polynucleotides are wound into a left-handed helix.
Zinc finger A common structural motif for attachment of
a protein to a DNA molecule.
Zoo blotting A technique that attempts to determine if a
DNA fragment contains a gene by hybridizing that fragment to DNA preparations from related species, on the
basis that genes have similar sequences in related
species and so give positive hybridization signals,
whereas the regions between genes have less similar
sequences and so do not hybridize.
Zygote The cell resulting from fusion of gametes during
meiosis.
