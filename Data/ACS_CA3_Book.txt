01 INTRODUCTION

THIRD EDITION
The Cancer Atlas
aims to open readers’
eyes to the facts and
figures of cancer: the
scale and magnitude
globally, the major
causes, and the
different ways the
disease can be
prevented and treated.
It is a comprehensive
global overview that
equally highlights
the distinct patterns
and inequities in
the present cancer
burden, the associated
risk factors, and the
prospects for cancer
prevention and control.

14

This third edition unites these topics under
the theme of “Access Creates Progress,”
drawing attention not only to the problem
at hand, but also the means of tackling
the cancer burden through access to
information and services—addressing
not only the immediate causes of cancer
but also the underlying drivers of disease
and disparities.
This third edition of The Cancer Atlas
maintains the structure of the previous
editions, with chapters grouped into three
sections: Risk Factors, The Burden, and
Taking Action.
The first section, RISK FACTORS, highlights
regional and international variations in
many of the major risk factors for cancer,
including tobacco use, infections, excess
body weight, and ultraviolet radiation.
Tobacco smoking continues to be the
predominant cause of cancer in most highincome countries, while infections still play
a major role in many sub-Saharan African
and Asian countries. The importance
of excess body weight as a major risk
factor for cancer continues to escalate in
most parts of the world, including many
economically transitioning countries.
The second section, THE BURDEN, describes
the geographic diversity in cancer
occurrence worldwide and, in separate
chapters, for each of the major world
regions. This burden is also described in
terms of the national Human Development
Index, the primary measure of a country’s
societal and economic development used
in this book. Profiles of cancer survival and
cancer survivorship are expanded in this
third edition, and global cancer survival
statistics are presented for the first time
in print, while pressing issues such as the

ACCESS CREATES PROGRESS

financial burden of cancer are highlighted.
A new chapter on cancer in Indigenous
populations describes the specific
challenges facing these underserved
populations around the world.

Estimated increase in the number of cancer cases
by site worldwide from 2018 to 2040

The final section, TAKING ACTION, describes
major interventions across the cancer
continuum, from the prevention of risk
factors to early detection, treatment, and
palliative care, highlighting disparities
in the availability and implementation of
these interventions across the world. It
also portrays the multiple organizations
working in cancer control and the
importance of policies and legislation and
building synergies between diseases and
health systems for broad implementation
of known interventions. In this edition, a
new chapter on universal health care and
“Access Creates Progress” text boxes in
chapters throughout the book highlight
successful strategies to address the
cancer burden.

30,000,000

In summary, The Cancer Atlas is intended
to deliver a rapid but comprehensive
grasp of the global essentials of cancer.
This book and its accompanying website
(canceratlas.cancer.org) were carefully
designed to ensure user-friendly,
accessible, and downloadable descriptions
and graphics can be easily used by cancer
control advocates, government and private
public health agencies, and policymakers,
as well as patients, survivors and the
general public. The Cancer Atlas is an
illustrative guide to cancer’s diversity and
disparities, but also a positive vehicle
for the promotion and delivery of cancer
prevention and cancer control worldwide.

…a major difference can be made in the incidence,

XX SECTION TITLE

RISK FACTORS

ACCESS
CREATES
PROGRESS

This section describes the prevalence of major cancer risk factors around the
world. Tobacco smoking remains the predominant cause of cancer in most high-income
countries, while infections play a major role in many low-income countries.

Progress in tobacco control
legislation over the last
decade means 1.5 billion
people in 55 countries are
now protected by smokefree legislation.

There are still 1.1 billion smokers worldwide
and tobacco causes more preventable
cancer deaths than any other risk factor.

OVERVIEW
OF RISK
FACTORS
Many of the known risk
factors for cancer can
be prevented.

MAP 2.1
Infectious agents can cause a wide range of
cancer types. FIGURE 2.1 However, there is large
variation across countries in the proportion of
cancers caused by infectious agents, ranging from
around 4% in many very high-income countries
to more than 50% in several sub-Saharan African
countries. As such, in many low-income countries
infection-related cancers are a leading cause of
cancer deaths (see 04, Infection). FIGURE 2.2

10 CANCER PREVENTION
RECOMMENDATIONS
While following each individual recommendation
protects against cancer, the greatest benefit
is gained by following all recommendations
together. Not smoking and avoiding other
exposure to tobacco and excess sun are also
important in reducing cancer risk.

THE BURDEN

ACCESS
CREATES
PROGRESS

This section describes the global cancer burden in terms of
incidence, mortality, prevalence, and survival for each major
world region as well as by Human Development Index.

With interventions to improve
early diagnosis and
adherence to appropriate
treatment, childhood cancer
survival can be increased to
60% in lower-income countries,
saving almost 1 million
children’s lives over
a decade.

Each year, about 270,000 cancer cases
are diagnosed in children. Today, five-year
survival from childhood cancer in
high income countries is greater than
80%, but it can be as low as 20% in
lower-income countries.

reducing tobacco smoking alone could prevent the

current and former smokers is available, but wide
dissemination of the procedure is unlikely in the
short term, even in high-income countries, because
of the need for a more advanced and coordinated

The variations observed in breast cancer

partly attributed to differences in the prevalence
and distribution of the major risk factors (e.g.
reproductive factors, obesity) and partly to the
degree of early detection and screening activities in

cancer at earlier stages, but also captures cases
that would have never been diagnosed otherwise.
As such, incidence rates are often higher in
countries that implement breast cancer screening
programs. In countries where the incidence of

doubling in Zimbabwe (breast) and South Africa
(both cancers) over the last 15 years. While the
cause of elevated rates for certain cancers such as
esophagus is still largely unknown, a westernization of lifestyle (e.g. dietary habits, fertility, excess
body weight, and physical inactivity) has been
related to observed increases in breast cancer, and
is expected to give rise to increases in rates of other
cancers such as colorectum. An improved awareness and increased capacity to perform
prostatectomies on older men has been suggested
to be linked to the increase in prostate cancer rates.

NET SURVIVAL is a measure of the
probability of surviving the cancer
diagnosed that is comparable
between countries, as it corrects
for differences between countries
in death from other diseases (noncancer mortality). Net survival
is often age-standardized for
comparability between countries
with different age distributions.

PROGRESS

This section describes effective interventions across the cancer continuum, from
prevention to early detection, treatment, and palliative care. Many organizations
work in the fight against cancer through research, health promotion, and policy.

Effective delivery of combined
high coverage screening and
vaccination could avert over
13 million cervical cancer cases
by 2069,and eventually lead
to cervical cancer being
eliminated as a major
public health problem.

Over the next half century, an estimated
44 million cervical cancer cases will occur
if current trends continue worldwide.

UNITED KINGDOM
Action

The 2018 United Kingdom (UK)
sugar-sweetened beverage tax utilized
a different strategy than other localities
by introducing a tiered tax based on
the amount of sugar in the beverage—a
high tax for drinks with >8g of sugar
per 100ml; a moderate tax for drinks
with 5–8g/100ml; and no tax for
drinks with <5g/100ml.

Result

The tax has already incentivized some
manufacturers to markedly reduce the
amount of sugar in their recipes, positively
affecting all those who consume these
beverages.
–
A 2017 modelling study examining the
potential impact of product reformulation
estimated that, with reduced sugar
content by 15–30%, the number of adults
and children with obesity would fall by
144,000, and there would be 19,000
fewer cases of diabetes per year in the UK.

THE ECONOMIC
BURDEN
OF CANCER
The economic burden
of cancer is substantial
in all countries and
reflects health care
spending as well
as lost productivity
due to morbidity and
premature death from
cancer. As cancer
treatment costs
increase, prevention
and early detection
efforts become more
cost-effective, and
potentially cost-saving.
The economic burden
of lost productivity due to
morbidity and premature
death from cancer
is nearly 60% of the total
economic burden associated
with cancer in European
Union countries.

I live in Sorø, Denmark and have

years ago, I lost my sister to cancer.
A few years later, I was diagnosed with the same
type of cancer. That left me in an indefinable state
of gratitude—had it not been for my sisters’ death, I
probably would not have survived.
When I came across Relay For Life, it immediately
made sense, simply because of the solidarity that
lies in the 24-hour event. My approach to Relay For
Life is that every single participant should go home
feeling part of a larger whole. In Relay For Life, we

HISTORY OF CANCER

BCE–18 CENTURY
TH

400 BCE

1492

17th–18th centuries

1775

The oldest known hominid malignant tumor was
found in Homo erectus or Australopithecus by Louis
Leakey in 1932.

Greek physician Hippocrates (460–370 BCE),
the “Father of Medicine,” believed illness was caused
by imbalance of four bodily humors: yellow bile,
black bile, blood, and phlegm. He was the first to
recognize differences between benign and
malignant tumors.

Christopher Columbus returned to Europe from the
Americas with the first tobacco leaves and seeds
ever seen on the continent. A crew member, Rodrigo
de Jerez, was seen smoking and was imprisoned by
the Inquisition, which believed he was possessed by
the devil.

Antony van Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) refined the
single lens microscope and was the first to see blood
cells and bacteria, aiding the better understanding of
cells, blood, and lymphatic system—major steps in
improving the understanding of cancer.

3000 BCE

Circa 250 BCE

1500

The first clinical picture of breast cancer,
including progression, metastasis, and death, and
prognosis approximately ten years after diagnosis, was described in The Nei Ching, or The Yellow
Emperor’s Classic of Internal Medicine. It gave the
first description of tumors and five forms of therapy:
spiritual, pharmacological, diet, acupuncture, and
treatment of respiratory diseases.

Autopsies were conducted more often and understanding of internal cancers grew.

Physician Le Dran (1685–1770) first recognized that
breast cancer could spread to the regional auxiliary
lymph nodes, carrying a poorer prognosis.

Dr. Percival Pott of Saint Bartholomew’s Hospital
in London described cancer in chimney sweeps
caused by soot collecting under the scrotum, the first
indication that exposure to chemicals in the environment could cause cancer. This research led to many
additional studies that identified other occupational
carcinogens and thence to public health measures to
reduce cancer risk.

Indian epic tale, the Ramayana, described
treatment with arsenic paste to thwart
tumor growth.

Surgery and cautery were used on smaller tumors.
Caustic pastes, usually containing arsenic, were
used on more extensive cancers, as well as phlebotomy (blood-letting), diet, herbal medicines, powder
of crab, and symbolic charms.

infections related to sexual contact in cancer risk,
and was the first indication that lifestyle might affect
the development of cancer.

Physicians and scientists performed systematic
experiments on cancer, leading to oncology as a

Joseph Recamier
COINED THE TERM “METASTASIS”

In the early 1800s, Scottish physician John Waldrop
proposed that “glioma of the retina,” which typically
appeared within the eyes of newborns and young
children and was usually lethal, might be cured via
early removal of affected organs.

1829

FRANCE

Gynecologist Joseph Recamier described the invasion of the bloodstream by cancer cells, coining the
term metastasis, which came to mean the distant
spread of cancer from its primary site to other
places in the body.
LEUKEMIA DESCRIBED AS A
PROLIFERATION OF BLOOD CELLS
by John Hughes Bennett

1838

GERMANY

Pathologist Johannes Müller demonstrated that cancer is made up of cells and not lymph. His student,
Rudolph Virchow (1821–1902), later proposed
that chronic inflammation—the site of a wound that
never heals—was the cause of cancer.

Domenico Antonio Rigoni-Stern undertook the first
major statistical analysis of cancer incidence and
mortality using 1760–1839 data from Verona.
This showed that more women than men died from
tumors, and that the most common female cancers
were breast and uterine (each accounting for a
third of total deaths). He found cancer death rates
for both sexes were rising, and concluded that
incidence of cancer increases with age, that cancer
is found less in the country than in the city, and that
unmarried people are more likely to contract the
disease.

First practical cigarette-making machine patented by
James Bonsack. It could produce 120,000
cigarettes a day, each machine doing the work
of 48 people. Production costs plummeted,
and—with the invention of the safety match a
few decades later—cigarette smoking began its
explosive growth.

Rudolph Virchow (1821–1902), “the founder of
cellular pathology,” also determined that all cells,
including cancer cells, are derived from other cells.
He was the first to coin the term “leukemia” and
believed that chronic inflammation was the cause
of cancer.

Marie Curie

OF HER WORK IN RADIOACTIVITY

Hereditary basis for cancer first suggested after
Professor Hilario de Gouvea of the Medical School
in Rio de Janeiro reported a family with increased
susceptibility to retinoblastoma.

Surgeon Stephen Paget (1855–1926) first
deduced that cancer cells spread to all organs
of the body by the bloodstream, but only grow
in the organ (“soil”) they find compatible. This laid the
groundwork for the true understanding
of metastasis.

1890s

1895

Professor William Stewart Halsted at Johns
Hopkins University developed the radical
mastectomy for breast cancer, removing breast,
underlying muscles, and lymph nodes under
the arm.

Physicist Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen
(1845–1923) discovered x-rays, used in the
diagnosis of cancer. Within a few years, this
led to the use of radiation for cancer treatment.

Dr. Thomas Beatson discovered that the breasts of
rabbits stopped producing milk after he removed the
ovaries. This control of one organ over another led
Beatson to test what would happen if the ovaries
were removed in patients suffering from advanced
breast cancer, and he found that oophorectomy
often resulted in improvement. He thus discovered
the stimulating effect of estrogen on breast tumors
long before the hormone was discovered. This
work provided a foundation for the modern use of
hormones and analogs (e.g. tamoxifen, taxol) for
treatment and prevention of breast cancer.

Dr. Charles B. Huggins’ (1901–97) research on
prostate cancer changed the way scientists regard
the behavior of all cancer cells, and for the first time
brought hope to the prospect of treating advanced
cancers. He showed that cancer cells were not
autonomous and self-perpetuating but were dependent on chemical signals such as hormones to grow
and survive, and that depriving cancer cells of these
signals could restore the health of patients with
widespread metastases. He was awarded the Nobel
Prize in 1966 (shared with Peyton Rous).

spread through the bloodstream and lymphatic
system to other parts of the body.

Cancer registry:
An institution that performs the systematic
collection and maintenance of a file or register of
all cancer cases occurring in a defined population.
Registries continuously and systematically collect

characteristics (e.g. stage, histologic classification)
of the cancers.

Cancer screening programs:
Programs organized at a national or regional level
that aim to decrease the incidence and mortality of a
specific type of cancer by identifying precancerous
lesions or tumors at an early stage, when they can

108

be effectively treated. Programs usually have: 1) an
explicit policy; 2) a team responsible for organizing
the screening and delivering appropriate healthcare;
and 3) a structure for assuring quality screening and
follow-up of abnormal screening tests.

Fecal occult blood test (FOBT):
A test used to screen for large bowel cancer. It looks
for blood in the stools, the presence of which may be
a sign of cancer.

ulcers in the stomach or small intestine. People with
H. pylori infections may be more likely to develop
cancer in the stomach.

Diagnosis:

Hematopoietic system:

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori):

Incidence:

Melanoma:

The number of new cases arising in a given period in
a specified population. This information, collected
routinely by cancer registries, can be expressed as
an absolute number of cases per year or as a rate
per 100,000 persons per year.

A cancerous (malignant) tumor that begins in the
cells that produce the skin coloring (melanocytes).
Melanoma is almost always curable in its early
stages. However, it is likely to spread, and once it
has spread to other parts of the body the likelihood
of cure decreases.

Kaposi sarcoma:
A type of cancer characterized by the abnormal
growth of blood vessels that develop into lesions on
the skin, lymph nodes, lining of the mouth, nose, and
throat, and other tissues of the body. It is caused by
human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). The risk of developing Kaposi sarcoma in a person who has HHV-8
increases significantly if the person is also infected
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

Menarche:

Keratinocyte (nonmelanoma) skin cancer:

Mesothelioma:

A measure of health, education and income at
the country level produced by the United Nations
Development Programme as an alternative to purely
economic assessments of national progress, such
as GDP growth.

Also known as basal or squamous cell skin cancer.
A cancer that occurs in keratinocyte cells, which are
located in the epidermis (top layer of skin) and are
responsible for producing keratin. Keratinocytes are
divided into squamous cells on the surface of the
epidermis and basal cells located within the deeper
basal layer of the epidermis.

as Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, or
KSHV.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV):
The virus that causes acquired immune deficiency
syndrome (AIDS). It is transmitted through blood
and other body fluids, and infants born to infected
mothers may also become infected. Infection with
both HIV and HHV-8 increases the risk of developing
Kaposi sarcoma.

Human papillomavirus (HPV):
A type of virus that can cause abnormal tissue
growth (for example, warts) and other changes to
cells. Long-term infection with certain types of
human papillomavirus (e.g., types 16 and 18) can
cause cervical cancer. HPV is also a risk factor
for anal, vaginal, vulvar, penile, oropharyngeal,
and squamous cell skin cancers. It is transmitted
through sexual contact.

GLOSSARY

SOURCES & METHODS

Particulate matter:

Sigmoidoscopy:

Years of life lost (YLL):

Microscopic solid or liquid particles associated with
the atmosphere that can penetrate the lungs and
cause damage that can lead to lung cancer. Particulate matter can be naturally occurring (e.g. originating from volcanoes or dust storms) or synthetic (e.g.
vehicle emissions). The smallest class of particulate
matter (<2.5 micrometers diameter) is the deadliest.

An examination to help find cancer or polyps within
the rectum and distal part of the colon. A slender,
hollow, lighted tube is placed into the rectum,
allowing the physician to look for polyps or other
abnormalities. The sigmoidoscope is shorter than
the colonoscope.

A statistic that measures the burden of premature
death in a population due to a specific cause (such
as cancer) within a specified time frame by aggregating the difference between expected life span
and years lived among those who died due to the
cause of interest.

Palliative care:

Solar irradiation:
See UV radiation.

Please refer to the U.S. National Cancer Institute’s
“Dictionary of Cancer Terms” for additional definitions (http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary).

An approach that aims to improve the quality of life
for patients and families facing the problems associated with life-threatening cancers. It provides for
prevention and relief of suffering through treatment
for pain and other symptoms as well as through
spiritual and psychosocial support, at the time of
cancer diagnosis, through the end of life, and during
family bereavement.

Prevalence:
The number of persons in a defined population who
have been diagnosed with a specific type of cancer,
and who are still alive at the end of a given year (the
survivors). Five-year prevalence limits the number
of patients to those diagnosed in the past 5 years.
It is a particularly useful measure of cancer burden
because for most cancers, patients who are still
alive five years after diagnosis are usually considered cured. However, exceptions to this include
breast cancer patients, who continue to die from the
disease 5 years after diagnosis.

Prognosis:
Prediction of the course of cancer, and the outlook
for a cure of the cancer.

Radiotherapy:
The use of radiation treatment to kill cancer cells or
stop them from dividing.

Radon:
A radioactive gas that is released by uranium—
a substance found in soil and rock—and is an
important risk factor for lung cancer.

Solid fuels:

Overview of Risk Factors

Targeted therapy:

Potentially modifiable risk factors:

A cancer treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack cancer cells while
avoiding harm to normal cells better than many other
cancer treatments. Some targeted therapies block
the mechanisms involved in the growth and spread
of cancer cells. Other types of targeted therapies
help the immune system kill cancer cells or deliver
toxic substances directly to cancer cells.

Note: Etiologic heterogeneity is an active area of
research for most of these cancers. For example,
there is active research into the disparate role of
parity in the etiology of estrogen receptor positive
compared to triple negative breast cancer. The table
considers the hormonal and reproductive risk factors
in association to risk of the cancer site overall.
Evidence is based more strongly on studies with
prospective exposure assessment.

“

While we face great challenges in this work, we also have the proven interventions,
dedicated global partners, and momentum we need to truly address the global cancer
burden. This Cancer Atlas, Third Edition is an important source of information to help
the global cancer community achieve our shared goal of a world without cancer.
— Gary Reedy, CEO, American Cancer Society

The Cancer Atlas, Third Edition has brought together cancer
control experts from around the world to present useful
and comprehensible information to aid in the fight against
cancer. This all-new edition is a comprehensive global
overview that equally highlights the distinct patterns and
inequities in the present cancer burden, the associated
risk factors, and the prospects for cancer prevention and
control. This edition unites these topics under the theme of
“Access Creates Progress,” drawing attention not only to
the problem at hand, but also the means of tackling the
cancer burden through access to information and services.
It provides basic information on the global burden of cancer
in a user-friendly and accessible form for cancer control
advocates, government and public health agencies, and
policymakers as well as patients, survivors, and the
general public.

Topics Include
Risks of tobacco
Body weight, physical activity, diet,
and alcohol as cancer risk factors
Infection-related cancers
Childhood cancers
Cancer in indigenous populations
The burden of cancer by world region
Cancer survival and survivorship issues
Vaccines
Early detection
Pain control
