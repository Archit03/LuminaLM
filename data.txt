PREFACE
THE writings of Shakespeare have been justly
termed “the richest, the purest, the fairest, that
genius uninspired ever penned.”
Shakespeare instructed by delighting. His
plays alone (leaving mere science out of the
question), contain more actual wisdom than the
whole body of English learning. He is the teacher of
all good—pity, generosity, true courage, love. His
bright wit is cut out “into little stars.” His solid
masses of knowledge are meted out in morsels and
proverbs, and thus distributed, there is scarcely a
corner of the English-speaking world to-day which
he does not illuminate, or a cottage which he does
not enrich. His bounty is like the sea, which, though
often unacknowledged, is everywhere felt. As his
friend, Ben Jonson, wrote of him, “He was not of an
age but for all time.” He ever kept the highroad of
human life whereon all travel. He did not pick out
by-paths of feeling and sentiment. In his creations
we have no moral highwaymen, sentimental thieves,
interesting villains, and amiable, elegant adventuresses—no delicate entanglements of situation, in
which the grossest images are presented to the mind
disguised under the superficial attraction of style and
sentiment. He flattered no bad passion, disguised no
vice in the garb of virtue, trifled with no just and

generous principle. While causing us to laugh at
folly, and shudder at crime, he still preserves our
love for our fellow-beings, and our reverence for
ourselves.
Shakespeare was familiar with all beautiful
forms and images, with all that is sweet or majestic
in the simple aspects of nature, of that indestructible
love of flowers and fragrance, and dews, and clear
waters—and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies
and woodland solitudes, and moon-light bowers,
which are the material elements of poetry,—and
with that fine sense of their indefinable relation to
mental emotion, which is its essence and vivifying
soul—and which, in the midst of his most busy and
tragical scenes, falls like gleams of sunshine on rocks
and ruins—contrasting with all that is rugged or
repulsive, and reminding us of the existence of purer
and brighter elements.
These things considered, what wonder is it
that the works of Shakespeare, next to the Bible, are
the most highly esteemed of all the classics of
English literature. “So extensively have the characters of Shakespeare been drawn upon by artists,
poets, and writers of fiction,” says an American
author,—“So interwoven are these charac-ters in the
great body of English literature, that to be ignorant
of the plot of these dramas is often a cause of
embarrassment.”
But Shakespeare wrote for grown-up people,
for men and women, and in words that little folks
cannot understand.

Hence this volume. To reproduce the
entertaining stories contained in the plays of
Shakespeare, in a form so simple that children can
understand and enjoy them, was the object had in
view by the author of these Beautiful Stories from
Shakespeare.
And that the youngest readers may not
stumble in pronouncing any unfamiliar names to be
met with in the stories, the editor has prepared and
included in the volume a Pronouncing Vocabulary of
Difficult Names. To which is added a collection of
Shakespearean Quotations, classified in alphabetical
order, illustrative of the wisdom and genius of the
world’s greatest dramatist.

A BRIEF LIFE OF
SHAKESPEARE
IN the register of baptisms of the parish
church of Stratford-upon-Avon, a market town in
Warwickshire, England, appears, under date of April
26, 1564, the entry of the baptism of William, the
son of John Shakspeare. The entry is in Latin—
“Gulielmus filius Johannis Shakspeare.”
The date of William Shakespeare’s birth has
usually been taken as three days before his baptism,
but there is certainly no evidence of this fact.
The family name was variously spelled, the
dramatist himself not always spelling it in the same
way. While in the baptismal record the name is
spelled “Shakspeare,” in several authentic autographs
of the dramatist it reads “Shakspere,” and in the first
edition of his works it is printed “Shakespeare.”
Halliwell tells us, that there are not less than
thirty-four ways in which the various members of
the Shakespeare family wrote the name, and in the
council-book of the corporation of Stratford, where
it is introduced one hundred and sixty-six times
during the period that the dramatist’s father was a
member of the municipal body, there are fourteen
different spellings. The modern “Shakespeare” is not
among them.

Shakespeare’s father, while an alderman at
Stratford, appears to have been unable to write his
name, but as at that time nine men out of ten were
content to make their mark for a signature, the fact
is not specially to his discredit.
The traditions and other sources of
information about the occupation of Shakespeare’s
father differ. He is described as a butcher, a woolstapler, and a glover, and it is not impossible that he
may have been all of these simultaneously or at
different times, or that if he could not properly be
called any one of them, the nature of his occupation
was such as to make it easy to understand how the
various traditions sprang up. He was a landed
proprietor and cultivator of his own land even
before his marriage, and he received with his wife,
who was Mary Arden, daughter of a country
gentleman, the estate of Asbies, 56 acres in extent.
William was the third child. The two older than he
were daughters, and both probably died in infancy.
After him were born three sons and a daughter. For
ten or twelve years at least, after Shakespeare’s birth
his father continued to be in easy circumstances. In
the year 1568 he was the high bailiff or chief
magistrate of Stratford, and for many years
afterwards he held the position of alderman as he
had done for three years before. To the completion
of his tenth year, therefore, it is natural to suppose
that William Shakespeare would get the best
education that Stratford could afford. The free
school of the town was open to all boys, and like all

the grammar-schools of that time, was under the
direction of men who, as graduates of the
universities, were qualified to diffuse that sound
scholarship which was once the boast of England.
There is no record of Shakespeare’s having been at
this school, but there can be no rational doubt that
he was educated there. His father could not have
procured for him a better education anywhere. To
those who have studied Shakespeare’s works without
being influenced by the old traditional theory that he
had received a very narrow education, they abound
with evidences that he must have been solidly
grounded in the learning, properly so called, taught
in the grammar schools.
There are local associations connected with
Stratford which could not be without their influence
in the formation of young Shakespeare’s mind.
Within the range of such a boy’s curiosity were the
fine old historic towns of Warwick and Coventry,
the sumptuous palace of Kenilworth, the grand
monastic remains of Evesham. His own Avon
abounded with spots of singular beauty, quiet
hamlets, solitary woods. Nor was Stratford shut out
from the general world, as many country towns are.
It was a great highway, and dealers with every variety
of merchandise resorted to its markets. The eyes of
the poet dramatist must always have been open for
observation. But nothing is known positively of
Shakespeare from his birth to his marriage to Anne
Hathaway in 1582, and from that date nothing but

the birth of three children until we find him an actor
in London about 1589.
How long acting continued to be
Shakespeare’s sole profession we have no means of
knowing, but it is in the highest degree probable that
very soon after arriving in London he began that
work of adaptation by which he is known to have
begun his literary career. To improve and alter older
plays not up to the standard that was required at the
time was a common practice even among the best
dramatists of the day, and Shakespeare’s abilities
would speedily mark him out as eminently fitted for
this kind of work. When the alterations in plays
originally composed by other writers became very
extensive, the work of adaptation would become in
reality a work of creation. And this is exactly what
we have examples of in a few of Shakespeare’s early
works, which are known to have been founded on
older plays.
It is unnecessary here to extol the published
works of the world’s greatest dramatist. Criticism has
been exhausted upon them, and the finest minds of
England, Germany, and America have devoted their
powers to an elucidation of their worth.
Shakespeare died at Stratford on the 23d of
April, 1616. His father had died before him, in 1602,
and his mother in 1608. His wife survived him till
August, 1623. His son Hamnet died in 1596 at the
age of eleven years. His two daughters survived him,
the eldest of whom, Susanna, had, in 1607, married a
physician of Stratford, Dr. Hall. The only issue of

this marriage, a daughter named Elizabeth, born in
1608, married first Thomas Nasbe, and afterwards
Sir John Barnard, but left no children by either
marriage. Shakespeare’s younger daughter, Judith, on
the 10th of February, 1616, married a Stratford
gentleman named Thomas Quincy, by whom she
had three sons, all of whom died, however, without
issue. There are thus no direct descendants of
Shakespeare.
Shakespeare’s fellow-actors, fellow-dramatists,
and those who knew him in other ways, agree in
expressing not only admiration of his genius, but
their respect and love for the man. Ben Jonson said,
“I love the man, and do honor his memory, on this
side idolatry, as much as any. He was indeed honest,
and of an open and free nature.” He was buried on
the second day after his death, on the north side of
the chancel of Stratford church. Over his grave there
is a flat stone with this inscription, said to have been
written by himself:
Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare
To digg the dust encloased heare:
Blest be ye man yt spares these stones,
And curst be he yt moves my bones.

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S
DREAM
HERMIA and Lysander were lovers; but
Hermia’s father wished her to marry another man,
named Demetrius.
Now, in Athens, where they lived, there was a
wicked law, by which any girl who refused to marry
according to her father’s wishes, might be put to
death. Hermia’s father was so angry with her for
refusing to do as he wished, that he actually brought
her before the Duke of Athens to ask that she might
be killed, if she still refused to obey him. The Duke
gave her four days to think about it, and, at the end
of that time, if she still refused to marry Demetrius,
she would have to die.
Lysander of course was nearly mad with grief,
and the best thing to do seemed to him for Hermia
to run away to his aunt’s house at a place beyond the
reach of that cruel law; and there he would come to
her and marry her. But before she started, she told
her friend, Helena, what she was going to do.
Helena had been Demetrius’ sweetheart long
before his marriage with Hermia had been thought
of, and being very silly, like all jealous people, she
1

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

could not see that it was not poor Hermia’s fault that
Demetrius wished to marry her instead of his own
lady, Helena. She knew that if she told Demetrius
that Hermia was going, as she was, to the wood
outside Athens, he would follow her, “and I can
follow him, and at least I shall see him,” she said to
herself. So she went to him, and betrayed her
friend’s secret.
Now this wood where
Lysander was to
meet Hermia,
and where the
other two had
decided to follow them, was
full of fairies,
as most woods
are, if one
only had the
eyes to see
them, and in this wood
on this night were the
King and Queen of the
fairies, Oberon and
Titania. Now fairies
are very wise people,
but now and then
they can be quite as
foolish as mortal
folk. Oberon and
Titania, who might

THE FAIRIES
have been as happy
2

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM

as the days were long, had thrown away all their joy
in a foolish quarrel. They never met without saying
disagreeable things to each other, and scolded each
other so dreadfully that all their little fairy followers,
for fear, would creep into acorn cups and hide them
there.
So, instead of keeping one happy Court and
dancing all night through in the moonlight as is
fairies’ use, the King with his attendants wandered
through one part of the wood, while the Queen with
hers kept state in another. And the cause of all this
trouble was a little Indian boy whom Titania had
taken to be one of her followers. Oberon wanted the
child to follow him and be one of his fairy knights;
but the Queen would not give him up.
On this night, in a mossy moonlit glade, the
King and Queen of the fairies met.
“Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania,” said
the King.
“What! jealous, Oberon?” answered the
Queen. “You spoil everything with your quarreling.
Come, fairies, let us leave him. I am not friends with
him now.”
“It rests with you to make up the quarrel,”
said the King.
“Give me that little Indian boy, and I will
again be your humble servant and suitor.”
“Set your mind at rest,” said the Queen.
“Your whole fairy kingdom buys not that boy from
me. Come, fairies.”
3

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

And she and her train rode off down the
moonbeams.
“Well, go your
ways,” said Oberon.
“But I’ll be even with
you before you leave
this wood.”
Then Oberon
called his favorite
fairy, Puck. Puck
was the spirit of
mischief. He used
to slip into the
dairies and take
the cream away,
and get into the
THE QUARREL
churn so that the
butter would not come, and turn the beer sour, and
lead people out of their way on dark nights and then
laugh at them, and tumble people’s stools from
under them when they were going to sit down, and
upset their hot ale over their chins when they were
going to drink.
“Now,” said Oberon to this little sprite,
“fetch me the flower called Love-in-idleness. The
juice of that little purple flower laid on the eyes of
those who sleep will make them, when they wake, to
love the first thing they see. I will put some of the
juice of that flower on my Titania’s eyes, and when
she wakes she will love the first thing she sees, were

4

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM

it lion, bear, or wolf, or bull, or meddling monkey, or
a busy ape.”

HELENA IN THE WOOD

While Puck was gone, Demetrius passed
through the glade followed by poor Helena, and still
she told him how she loved him and reminded him
of all his promises, and still he told her that he did
5

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

not and could not love her, and that his promises
were nothing. Oberon was sorry for poor Helena,
and when Puck returned with the flower, he bade
him follow Demetrius and put some of the juice on
his eyes, so that he might love Helena when he woke
and looked on her, as much as she loved him. So
Puck set off, and wandering through the wood
found, not Demetrius, but Lysander, on whose eyes
he put the juice; but when Lysander woke, he saw
not his own Hermia, but Helena, who was walking
through the wood looking for the cruel Demetrius;
and directly he saw her he loved her and left his own
lady, under the spell of the purple flower.
When Hermia woke she found Lysander
gone, and wandered about the wood trying to find
him. Puck went back and told Oberon what he had
done, and Oberon soon found that he had made a
mistake, and set about looking for Demetrius, and
having found him, put some of the juice on his eyes.
And the first thing Demetrius saw when he woke
was also Helena. So now Demetrius and Lysander
were both following her through the wood, and it
was Hermia’s turn to follow her lover as Helena had
done before. The end of it was that Helena and
Hermia began to quarrel, and Demetrius and
Lysander went off to fight. Oberon was very sorry to
see his kind scheme to help these lovers turn out so
badly. So he said to Puck—
“These two young men are going to fight.
You must overhang the night with drooping fog, and
lead them so astray, that one will never find the
other. When they are tired out, they will fall asleep.
6

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM

Then drop this other herb on Lysander’s eyes. That
will give him his old sight and his old love. Then
each man will have the lady who loves him, and they
will all think that this has been only a Midsummer
Night’s Dream. Then when this is done, all will be
well with them.”
So Puck went and did as he was told, and
when the two had fallen asleep without meeting each
other, Puck poured the juice on Lysander’s eyes, and
said:—
“When thou wakest,
Thou takest
True delight
In the sight
Of thy former lady’s eye:
Jack shall have Jill;
Nought shall go ill.”

Meanwhile Oberon found Titania asleep on a
bank where grew wild thyme, oxlips, and violets, and
woodbine, musk-roses and eglantine. There Titania
always slept a part of the night, wrapped in the
enameled skin of a snake. Oberon stooped over her
and laid the juice on her eyes, saying:—
“What thou seest when thou wake,
Do it for thy true love take.”

Now, it happened that when Titania woke the
first thing she saw was a stupid clown, one of a party
of players who had come out into the wood to
7

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

rehearse their play. This clown had met with Puck,
who had clapped an ass’s head on his shoulders so
that it looked as if it grew there. Directly Titania
woke and saw this dreadful monster, she said, “What
angel is this? Are you as wise as you are beautiful?”
“If I am wise enough to find my way out of
this wood, that’s enough for me,” said the foolish
clown.

TITANIA PLACED UNDER A SPELL

“Do not desire to go out of the wood,” said
Titania. The spell of the love-juice was on her, and
to her the clown seemed the most beautiful and
delightful creature on all the earth. “I love you,” she

8

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM

went on. “Come with me, and I will give you fairies
to attend on you.”
So she called four fairies, whose names were
Peaseblossom, Cobweb, Moth, and Mustardseed.
“You must attend this gentleman,” said the
Queen. “Feed him with apricots and dewberries,
purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries. Steal
honey-bags for him from the bumble-bees, and with
the wings of painted butterflies fan the moonbeams
from his sleeping eyes.”
“I will,” said one of the fairies, and all the
others said, “I will.”
“Now, sit down with me,” said the Queen to
the clown, “and let me stroke your dear cheeks, and
stick musk-roses
in your smooth,
sleek head, and
kiss your fair
large ears, my
gentle joy.”
“Where’s
Peaseblossom?”
asked the clown
with the ass’s
head. He did not
care much about
TITANIA AWAKES
the Queen’s affecttion, but he was very proud of having fairies to wait
on him. “Ready,” said Peaseblossom.

TITANIA AND THE CLOWN

A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM

“Scratch my head, Peaseblossom,” said the
clown. “Where’s Cobweb?” “Ready,” said Cobweb.
“Kill me,” said the clown, “the red bumblebee on the top of the thistle yonder, and bring me
the honey-bag. Where’s Mustardseed?”
“Ready,” said Mustardseed.
“Oh, I want nothing,” said the clown. “Only
just help Cobweb to scratch. I must go to the
barber’s, for methinks I am marvelous hairy about
the face.”
“Would you like anything to eat?” said the
fairy Queen.
“I should like some good dry oats,” said the
clown—for his donkey’s head made him desire
donkey’s food—“and some hay to follow.”
“Shall some of my fairies fetch you new nuts
from the squirrel’s house?” asked the Queen.
“I’d rather have a handful or two of good
dried peas,” said the clown. “But please don’t let any
of your people disturb me; I am going to sleep.”
Then said the Queen, “And I will wind thee in
my arms.”
And so when Oberon came along he found
his beautiful Queen lavishing kisses and endearments
on a clown with a donkey’s head.
And before he released her from the
enchantment, he persuaded her to give him the little
Indian boy he so much desired to have. Then he
took pity on her, and threw some juice of the
11

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

disenchanting flower on her pretty eyes; and then in
a moment she saw plainly the donkey-headed clown
she had been loving, and knew how foolish she had
been.
Oberon took off the ass’s head from the
clown, and left him to finish his sleep with his own
silly head lying on the thyme and violets.
Thus all was made plain and straight again.
Oberon and Titania loved each other more than
ever. Demetrius thought of no one but Helena, and
Helena had never had any thought of anyone but
Demetrius.
As for Hermia and Lysander, they were as
loving a couple as you could meet in a day’s march,
even through a fairy wood.
So the four mortal lovers went back to Athens
and were married; and the fairy King and Queen live
happily together in that very wood at this very day.

12

PROSPERO, the Duke of Milan, was a
learned and studious man, who lived among his
books, leaving the management of his dukedom to
his brother Antonio, in whom indeed he had
complete trust. But that trust was ill-rewarded, for
Antonio wanted to wear the duke’s crown himself,
and, to gain his ends, would have killed his brother
but for the love the people bore him. However, with
the help of Prospero’s great enemy, Alonso, King of
Naples, he managed to get into his hands the
dukedom with all its honor, power, and riches. For
they took Prospero to sea, and when they were far
away from land, forced him into a little boat with no
tackle, mast, or sail. In their cruelty and hatred they
put his little daughter, Miranda (not yet three years
old), into the boat with him, and sailed away, leaving
them to their fate.
But one among the courtiers with Antonio
was true to his rightful master, Prospero. To save the
duke from his enemies was impossible, but much
13

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

could be done to remind him of a subject’s love. So
this worthy lord, whose name was Gonzalo, secretly
placed in the boat some fresh water, provisions, and
clothes, and what Prospero valued most of all, some
of his precious books.
The boat was cast on an island, and Prospero
and his little one landed in safety. Now this island
was enchanted, and for years had lain under the spell
of a fell witch, Sycorax, who had imprisoned in the
trunks of trees all the good spirits she found there.
She died shortly before Prospero was cast on those
shores, but the spirits, of whom Ariel was the chief,
still remained in their prisons.
Prospero was a great magician, for he had
devoted himself almost entirely to the study of magic
during the years in which he allowed his brother to
manage the affairs of Milan. By his art he set free the
imprisoned spirits, yet kept them obedient to his
will, and they were more truly his subjects than his
people in Milan had been. For he treated them
kindly as long as they did his bidding, and he
exercised his power over them wisely and well. One
creature alone he found it necessary to treat with
harshness: this was Caliban, the son of the wicked
old witch, a hideous, deformed monster, horrible to
look on, and vicious and brutal in all his habits.
When Miranda was grown up into a maiden,
sweet and fair to see, it chanced that Antonio and
Alonso, with Sebastian, his brother, and Ferdinand,
his son, were at sea together with old Gonzalo, and
their ship came near Prospero’s island. Prospero,
14

THE TEMPEST

knowing they were there, raised by his art a great
storm, so that even the sailors on board gave
themselves up for lost; and first among them all
Prince Ferdinand leaped into the sea, and, as his
father thought in his grief, was drowned. But Ariel
brought him safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew,
although they were washed overboard, were landed
unhurt in differrent parts of the
island, and the
good ship herself, which they
all thought had
been wrecked,
lay at anchor in
the harbor whither Ariel had
brought her.
Such wonders
PRINCE FERDINAND IN THE SEA
could Prospero
and his spirits perform.
While yet the tempest was raging, Prospero
showed his daughter the brave ship laboring in the
trough of the sea, and told her that it was filled with
living human beings like themselves. She, in pity of
their lives, prayed him who had raised this storm to
quell it. Then her father bade her to have no fear, for
he intended to save every one of them.
Then, for the first time, he told her the story
of his life and hers, and that he had caused this
storm to rise in order that his enemies, Antonio and

15

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

Alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into
his hands.
When he had made an end of his story he
charmed her into sleep, for Ariel was at hand, and he
had work for him to do. Ariel, who longed for his
complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery,
but on being threateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone when Sycorax ruled in the
land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the
master who had made those sufferings to end, he
ceased to complain, and promised faithfully to do
whatever Prospero might command.
“Do so,” said Prospero, “and in two days I
will discharge thee.”
Then he bade Ariel take the form of a water
nymph and sent him in search of the young prince.
And Ariel, invisible to Ferdinand, hovered near him,
singing the while—
“Come unto these yellow sands
And then take hands:
Court’sied when you have, and kiss’d
(The wild waves whist),
Foot it featly here and there;
And, sweet sprites, the burden bear!”

And Ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the
song changed to a solemn air, and the words
brought grief to his heart, and tears to his eyes, for
thus they ran—

16

THE TEMPEST
“Full fathom five thy father lies;
Of his bones are coral made.
Those are pearls that were his eyes,
Nothing of him that doth fade,
But doth suffer a sea-change
Into something rich and strange.
Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.
Hark! now I hear them,—ding dong bell!”

And so singing, Ariel led the spell-bound prince into
the presence of Prospero and Miranda. Then,
behold! all happened as Prospero desired. For
Miranda, who had never, since she could first
remember, seen any human being save her father,
looked on the
youthful prince
with reverence
in her eyes,
and love in her
secret heart.
“I might
call him,” she
said, “a thing
divine, for nothing natural I ever
saw so noble!”

PRINCE FERDINAND
SEES MIRANDA

And Ferdinand, beholding her beauty with
wonder and delight, exclaimed—
“Most sure the goddess on whom these airs
attend!”
Nor did he attempt to hide the passion which
she inspired in him, for scarcely had they exchanged
17

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

half a dozen sentences, before he vowed to make her
his queen if she were willing. But Prospero, though
secretly delighted, pretended wrath.
“You come here as a spy,” he said to
Ferdinand. “I will manacle your neck and feet
together, and you shall feed on fresh water mussels,
withered roots and husk, and have sea-water to
drink. Follow.”
“No,” said Ferdinand, and drew his sword.
But on the instant Prospero charmed him so that he
stood there like a statue, still as stone; and Miranda
in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her
lover. But he harshly refused her, and made
Ferdinand follow him to his cell. There he set the
Prince to work, making him remove thousands of
heavy logs of timber and pile them up; and
Ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought his toil all
too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet
Miranda.
She in very pity would have helped him in his
hard work, but he would not let her, yet he could not
keep from her the secret of his love, and she, hearing
it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.
Then Prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, he gave his consent to their
marriage.
“Take her,” he said, “she is thine own.”
In the meantime, Antonio and Sebastian
would succeed to the throne on Alonso’s death. And

they would have carried out their wicked purpose
while their victim was asleep, but that Ariel woke
him in good time.
Many tricks did Ariel play them. Once he set a
banquet before them, and just as they were going to
fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder and
lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the
banquet disappeared. Then Ariel upbraided them
with their sins and vanished too.
Prospero by his enchantments drew them all
to the grove without his cell, where they waited,
trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly
repenting them of their sins.
Prospero determined to make one last use of
his magic power, “And then,” said he, “I’ll break my
staff and deeper than did ever plummet sound I’ll
drown my book.”
So he made heavenly music to sound in the
air, and appeared to them in his proper shape as the
Duke of Milan. Because they repented, he forgave
them and told them the story of his life since they
had cruelly committed him and his baby daughter to
the mercy of wind and waves. Alonso, who seemed
sorriest of them all for his past crimes, lamented the
loss of his heir. But Prospero drew back a curtain
and showed them Ferdinand and Miranda playing at
chess. Great was Alonso’s joy to greet his loved son
again, and when he heard that the fair maid with
whom Ferdinand was playing was Prospero’s
daughter, and that the young folks had plighted their
troth, he said—
20

THE TEMPEST

“Give me your hands, let grief and sorrow still
embrace his heart that doth not wish you joy.”
So all ended
happily. The ship
was safe in the
harbor, and next
day they all set
sail for Naples,
where Ferdinand
and Miranda
were to be
married. Ariel
gave them calm
seas and auspicious gales; and
many were the
rejoicings at the wedding.

PLAYING CHESS

Then Prospero, after many years of absence,
went back to his own dukedom, where he was
welcomed with great joy by his faithful subjects. He
practiced the arts of magic no more, but his life was
happy, and not only because he had found his own
again, but chiefly because, when his bitterest foes
who had done him deadly wrong lay at his mercy, he
took no vengeance on them, but nobly forgave
them.
As for Ariel, Prospero made him free as air,
so that he could wander where he would, and sing
with a light heart his sweet song—

“Where the bee sucks, there suck I:
In a cowslip’s bell I lie;
There I couch when owls do cry.
On the bat’s back I do fly
After summer, merrily:
Merrily, merrily, shall I live now,
Under the blossom that hangs on the

22

AS YOU LIKE IT
THERE was once a wicked Duke named
Frederick, who took the dukedom that should have
belonged to his brother, sending him into exile. His
brother went into the Forest of Arden, where he
lived the life of a bold forester, as Robin Hood did
in Sherwood Forest in merry England.
The banished Duke’s daughter, Rosalind,
remained with Celia, Frederick’s daughter, and the
two loved each other more than most sisters. One
day there was a wrestling match at Court, and
Rosalind and Celia went to see it. Charles, a
celebrated wrestler, was there, who had killed many
men in contests of this kind. Orlando, the young
man he was to wrestle with, was so slender and
youthful, that Rosalind and Celia thought he would
surely be killed, as others had been; so they spoke to
him, and asked him not to attempt so dangerous an
adventure; but the only effect of their words was to
make him wish more to come off well in the
encounter, so as to win praise from such sweet
ladies.
Orlando, like Rosalind’s father, was being
kept out of his inheritance by his brother, and was so
23

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

sad at his brother’s unkindness that, until he saw
Rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or
died. But now the sight of the fair Rosalind gave him
strength and courage, so that he did marvelously,
and at last, threw Charles to such a tune, that the
wrestler had to be carried off the ground. Duke
Frederick was pleased with his courage, and asked
his name.

ROSALIND AND CELIA

“My name is Orlando, and I am the youngest
son of Sir Rowland de Boys,” said the young man.
Now Sir Rowland de Boys, when he was alive,
had been a good friend to the banished Duke, so
that Frederick heard with regret whose son Orlando
24

AS YOU LIKE IT

was, and would not befriend him. But Rosalind was
delighted to hear that this handsome young stranger
was the son of her father’s old friend, and as they
were going away, she turned back more than once to
say another kind word to the brave young man.
“Gentleman,” she said, giving him a chain
from her neck, “wear this for me. I could give more,
but that my hand lacks means.”

ROSALIND GIVES ORLANDO A CHAIN

Rosalind and Celia, when they were alone,
began to talk about the handsome wrestler, and
Rosalind confessed that she loved him at first sight.
“Come, come,” said Celia, “wrestle with thy
affections.”
“Oh,” answered Rosalind, “they take the part
of a better wrestler than myself. Look, here comes
the Duke.”
25

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

“With his eyes full of anger,” said Celia.
“You must leave the Court at once,” he said
to Rosalind. “Why?” she asked.
“Never mind why,” answered the Duke, “you
are banished. If within ten days you are found within
twenty miles of my Court, you die.”
So Rosalind set out to seek her father, the
banished Duke, in the Forest of Arden. Celia loved
her too much to let her go alone, and as it was rather
a dangerous journey, Rosalind, being the taller,
dressed up as a young countryman, and her cousin as
a country girl, and Rosalind said that she would be
called Ganymede, and Celia, Aliena. They were very
tired when at last they came to the Forest of Arden,
and as they were sitting on the grass a countryman
passed that way, and Ganymede asked him if he
could get them food. He did so, and told them that a
shepherd’s flocks and house were to be sold. They
bought these and settled down as shepherd and
shepherdess in the forest.
In the meantime, Oliver having sought to take
his brother Orlando’s life, Orlando also wandered
into the forest, and there met with the rightful Duke,
and being kindly received, stayed with him. Now,
Orlando could think of nothing but Rosalind, and he
went about the forest carving her name on trees, and
writing love sonnets and hanging them on the
bushes, and there Rosalind and Celia found them.
One day Orlando met them, but he did not know
Rosalind in her boy’s clothes, though he liked the

26

AS YOU LIKE IT

pretty shepherd youth, because he fancied a likeness
in him to her he loved.
“There is a foolish lover,” said Rosalind,
“who haunts these woods and hangs sonnets on the
trees. If I could find him, I would soon cure him of
his folly.”
Orlando confessed that he was the foolish
lover, and Rosalind said—“If you will come and see
me every day, I will pretend to be Rosalind, and I
will take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is
the way of women, till I make you ashamed of your
folly in loving her.”
And so every day he went to her house, and
took a pleasure in saying to her all the pretty things
he would have said to Rosalind; and she had the fine
and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words
came to the right ears. Thus many days passed
pleasantly away.
One morning, as Orlando was going to visit
Ganymede, he saw a man asleep on the ground, and
that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting for
the man who was asleep to wake: for they say that
lions will not prey on anything that is dead or
sleeping. Then Orlando looked at the man, and saw
that it was his wicked brother, Oliver, who had tried
to take his life. He fought with the lioness and killed
her, and saved his brother’s life.
While Orlando was fighting the lioness, Oliver
woke to see his brother, whom he had treated so
badly, saving him from a wild beast at the risk of his
own life. This made him repent of his wickedness,
27

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

and he begged Orlando’s pardon, and from
thenceforth they were dear brothers. The lioness had
wounded Orlando’s arm so much, that he could not
go on to see the shepherd, so he sent his brother to
ask Ganymede to come to him.

GANYMEDE FAINTS

Oliver went and told the whole story to
Ganymede and Aliena, and Aliena was so charmed
with his manly way of confessing his faults, that she
fell in love with him at once. But when Ganymede
heard of the danger Orlando had been in she fainted;
and when she came to herself, said truly enough, “I
should have been a woman by right.”
Oliver went back to his brother and told him
all this, saying, “I love Aliena so well that I will give

28

AS YOU LIKE IT

up my estates to you and marry her, and live here as
a shepherd.”
“Let your wedding be to-morrow,” said
Orlando, “and I will ask the Duke and his friends.”
When Orlando told Ganymede how his
brother was to be married on the morrow, he added:
“Oh, how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness
through another man’s eyes.”
Then answered Rosalind, still in Ganymede’s
dress and speaking with his voice—“If you do love
Rosalind so near the heart, then when your brother
marries Aliena, shall you marry her.”
Now the next day the Duke and his followers,
and Orlando, and Oliver, and Aliena, were all
gathered together for the wedding.
Then Ganymede came in and said to the
Duke, “If I bring in your daughter Rosalind, will you
give her to Orlando here?” “That I would,” said the
Duke, “if I had all kingdoms to give with her.”
“And you say you will have her when I bring
her?” she said to Orlando. “That would I,” he
answered, “were I king of all kingdoms.”
Then Rosalind and Celia went out, and
Rosalind put on her pretty woman’s clothes again,
and after a while came back.
She turned to her father—“I give myself to
you, for I am yours.” “If there be truth in sight,” he
said, “you are my daughter.”

29

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

Then she said to Orlando, “I give myself to
you, for I am yours.” “If there be truth in sight,” he
said, “you are my Rosalind.”
“I will have no father if you be not he,” she
said to the Duke, and to Orlando, “I will have no
husband if you be not he.”
So Orlando and Rosalind were married, and
Oliver and Celia, and they lived happy ever after,
returning with the Duke to the kingdom. For
Frederick had been shown by a holy hermit the
wickedness of his ways, and so gave back the
dukedom of his brother, and himself went into a
monastery to pray for forgiveness.
The wedding was a merry one, in the mossy
glades of the forest. A shepherd and shepherdess
who had been friends with Rosalind, when she was
herself disguised as a shepherd, were married on the
same day, and all with such pretty feastings and
merrymakings as could be nowhere within four
walls, but only in the beautiful green wood.

30

THE WINTER’S TALE
LEONTES was the King of Sicily, and his
dearest friend was Polixenes, King of Bohemia. They
had been brought up together, and only separated
when they reached man’s estate and each had to go
and rule over his kingdom. After many years, when
each was married and had a son, Polixenes came to
stay with Leontes in Sicily.
Leontes was a violent-tempered man and
rather silly, and he took it into his stupid head that
his wife, Hermione, liked Polixenes better than she
did him, her own husband. When once he had got
this into his head, nothing could put it out; and he
ordered one of his lords, Camillo, to put a poison in
Polixenes’ wine. Camillo tried to dissuade him from
this wicked action, but finding he was not to be
moved, pretended to consent. He then told
Polixenes what was proposed against him, and they
fled from the Court of Sicily that night, and returned
to Bohemia, where Camillo lived on as Polixenes’
friend and counselor.
Leontes threw the Queen into prison; and her
son, the heir to the throne, died of sorrow to see his
mother so unjustly and cruelly treated.
31

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

While the Queen was in prison she had a little
baby, and a friend of hers, named Paulina, had the
baby dressed in its best, and took it to show the
King, thinking that the sight of his helpless little
daughter would soften his heart towards his dear
Queen, who had never done him any wrong, and
who loved him a great deal more than he deserved;
but the King would not look at the baby, and
ordered Paulina’s husband to
take it away in a ship, and
leave it in the most desert
and dreadful place he
could find, which Paulina’s husband, very much
against his will, was
obliged to do.
Then the
poor Queen was
brought up to be
tried for treason
in preferring
Polixenes to
her King; but
THE KING WOULD NOT LOOK
really she had
never thought of anyone except Leontes, her
husband. Leontes had sent some messengers to ask
the god, Apollo, whether he was not right in his
cruel thoughts of the Queen. But he had not
patience to wait till they came back, and so it
happened that they arrived in the middle of the trial.
The Oracle said—

32

THE WINTER’S TALE

“Hermione is innocent, Polixenes blameless,
Camillo a true subject, Leontes a jealous tyrant, and
the King shall live without an heir, if that which is
lost be not found.”
Then a man came and told them that the little
Prince was dead. The poor Queen, hearing this, fell
down in a fit; and then the King saw how wicked
and wrong he had been. He ordered Paulina and the
ladies who were with the Queen to take her away,
and try to restore her. But Paulina came back in a
few moments, and told the King that Hermione was
dead.
Now Leontes’ eyes were at last opened to his
folly. His Queen was dead, and the little daughter
who might have been a comfort to him he had sent
away to be the prey of wolves and kites. Life had
nothing left for him now. He gave himself up to his
grief, and passed many sad years in prayer and
remorse.
The baby Princess was left on the seacoast of
Bohemia, the very kingdom where Polixenes
reigned. Paulina’s husband never went home to tell
Leontes where he had left the baby; for as he was
going back to the ship, he met a bear and was torn
to pieces. So there was an end of him.
But the poor deserted little baby was found by
a shepherd. She was richly dressed, and had with her
some jewels, and a paper was pinned to her cloak,
saying that her name was Perdita, and that she came
of noble parents.

33

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

LEFT ON THE SEA-COAST

The shepherd, being a kind-hearted man, took
home the little baby to his wife, and they brought it
up as their own child. She had no more teaching
than a shepherd’s child generally has, but she
inherited from her royal mother many graces and
charms, so that she was quite different from the
other maidens in the village where she lived.
One day Prince Florizel, the son of the good
King of Bohemia, was hunting near the shepherd’s
house and saw Perdita, now grown up to a charming
woman. He made friends with the shepherd, not
telling him that he was the Prince, but saying that his
name was Doricles, and that he was a private
gentleman; and then, being deeply in love with the
pretty Perdita, he came almost daily to see her.
The King could not understand what it was
that took his son nearly every day from home; so he
set people to watch him, and then found out that the
34

THE WINTER’S TALE

PRINCE FLORIZEL AND PERDITA

35

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

heir of the King of Bohemia was in love with
Perdita, the pretty shepherd girl. Polixenes, wishing
to see whether this was true, disguised himself, and
went with the faithful Camillo, in disguise too, to the
old shepherd’s house. They arrived at the feast of
sheep-shearing, and, though strangers, they were
made very welcome. There was dancing going on,
and a peddler was selling ribbons and laces and
gloves, which the young men bought for their
sweethearts.
Florizel and Perdita, however, were taking no
part in this gay scene, but sat quietly together talking.
The King noticed the charming manners and great
beauty of Perdita, never guessing that she was the
daughter of his old friend, Leontes. He said to
Camillo—
“This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
ran on the green sward. Nothing she does or seems
but smacks of something greater than herself—too
noble for this place.”
And Camillo answered, “In truth she is the
Queen of curds and cream.”
But when Florizel, who did not recognize his
father, called upon the strangers to witness his
betrothal with the pretty shepherdess, the King
made himself known and forbade the marriage,
adding that if ever she saw Florizel again, he would
kill her and her old father, the shepherd; and with
that he left them. But Camillo remained behind, for
he was charmed with Perdita, and wished to befriend
her.
36

THE WINTER’S TALE

Camillo had long known how sorry Leontes
was for that foolish madness of his, and he longed to
go back to Sicily to see his old master. He now
proposed that the young people should go there and
claim the protection of Leontes. So they went, and
the shepherd went with them, taking Perdita’s jewels,
her baby clothes, and the paper he had found pinned
to her cloak.

LEONTES RECEIVING FLORIZEL AND PERDITA

Leontes received them with great kindness.
He was very polite to Prince Florizel, but all his
looks were for Perdita. He saw how much she was
like the Queen Hermione, and said again and
again—
“Such a sweet creature my daughter might
have been, if I had not cruelly sent her from me.”
37

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

When the old shepherd heard that the King
had lost a baby daughter, who had been left upon
the coast of Bohemia, he felt sure that Perdita, the
child he had reared, must be the King’s daughter,
and when he told his tale and showed the jewels and
the paper, the King perceived that Perdita was
indeed his long-lost child. He welcomed her with
joy, and rewarded the good shepherd.
Polixenes had hastened after his son to
prevent his marriage with Perdita, but when he
found that she was the daughter of his old friend, he
was only too glad to give his consent.
Yet Leontes
could not be
happy. He remembered how
his fair Queen,
who should
have been at
his side to
share his joy in
his daughter’s
happiness, was
dead through
FLORIZEL AND PERDITA TALKING
his unkindness,
and he could say nothing for a long time but—
“Oh, thy mother! thy mother!” and ask
forgiveness of the King of Bohemia, and then kiss
his daughter again, and then the Prince Florizel, and
then thank the old shepherd for all his goodness.

38

THE WINTER’S TALE

Then Paulina, who had been high all these
years in the King’s favor, because of her kindness to
the dead Queen Hermione, said—“I have a statue
made in the likeness of the dead Queen, a piece
many years in doing, and performed by the rare
Italian master, Giulio Romano. I keep it in a private
house apart, and there, ever since you lost your
Queen, I have gone twice or thrice a day. Will it
please your Majesty to go and see the statue?”
So Leontes and Polixenes, and Florizel and
Perdita, with Camillo and their attendants, went to
Paulina’s house where there was a heavy purple
curtain screening off an alcove; and Paulina, with her
hand on the curtain, said—
“She was peerless when she was alive, and I
do believe that her dead likeness excels whatever yet
you have looked upon, or that the hand of man hath
done. Therefore I keep it lonely, apart. But here it
is—behold, and say, ’tis well.”
And with that she drew back the curtain and
showed them the statue. The King gazed and gazed
on the beautiful statue of his dead wife, but said
nothing.
“I like your silence,” said Paulina; “it the more
shows off your wonder. But speak, is it not like
her?”
“It is almost herself,” said the King, “and yet,
Paulina, Hermione was not so much wrinkled,
nothing like so old as this seems.”
“Oh, not by much,” said Polixenes.
39

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

“Ah,” said Paulina, “that is the cleverness of
the carver, who shows her to us as she would have
been had she lived till now.”

HERMIONE

40

THE WINTER’S TALE

And still Leontes looked at the statue and
could not take his eyes away.
“If I had known,” said Paulina, “that this poor
image would so have stirred your grief, and love, I
would not have shown it to you.”
But he only answered, “Do not draw the
curtain.”
“No, you must not look any longer,” said
Paulina, “or you will think it moves.”
“Let be! let be!” said the King. “Would you
not think it breathed?”
“I will draw the curtain,” said Paulina; “you
will think it lives presently.”
“Ah, sweet Paulina,” said Leontes, “make me
to think so twenty years together.”
“If you can bear it,” said Paulina, “I can make
the statue move, make it come down and take you
by the hand. Only you would think it was by wicked
magic.”
“Whatever you can make her do, I am content
to look on,” said the King.
And then, all folks there admiring and
beholding, the statue moved from its pedestal, and
came down the steps and put its arms round the
King’s neck, and he held her face and kissed her
many times, for this was no statue, but the real living
Queen Hermione herself. She had lived hidden, by
Paulina’s kindness, all these years, and would not
discover herself to her husband, though she knew he
41

BEAUTIFUL STORIES FROM SHAKESPEARE

had repented, because she could not quite forgive
him till she knew what had become of her little baby.
Now that Perdita was found, she forgave her
husband everything, and it was like a new and
beautiful marriage to them, to be together once
more.
Florizel and Perdita were married and lived
long and happily.
To Leontes his many years of suffering were
well paid for in the moment when, after long grief
and pain, he felt the arms of his true love around
him once again.
